// The agency slice's events as held poses and short sequences (docs/director/agency-slice-3.md, docs/combat/alchemist-recipes.md section 3,
// docs/legal/agency-pass-screen.md section 2), played by AnimFighter.on_agency over the active ragdoll. The events: knockback (kind slideShort, slideLong, drift),
// embed (World: driven into the ground, held down 60 ticks), the cues taunt_start (a far taunt, 45 ticks, while he keeps flying), charge_light, charge_heavy
// and charge_feint. Held poses are mixed for as long as the event says; sequences are played by the entry layer. data/anim/agency.json names which event
// plays which, how strongly and for how long. Legal: the charges follow the dash rule (not both arms trailed straight back, not one fist punched ahead, drawn
// the whole way); a taunt never beckons; no crossed arms, no scream, no aura. Originality: no franchise pose; each pose has an _orig line.
