// The last stand (docs/architecture/last-stand.md): the first time a fighter reaches the brink his signature is free for 20 s. Events: last_stand_ready {actor, dur},
// last_stand_end {actor, kind: used | expired}. The body cue: on ready, a steadying beat in his own shape (the hurt body gathering itself: a breath, the head
// up, the chest open), then a held resolve while the window is open, and a slump if it expires (a used window hands over to the signature's own animation).
// Played by AnimFighter.on_last_stand over the wounded stance. Hands open throughout; no crossed arms, no clenched fists at the sides, no scream, no aura
// (the stacking rule: this is a pose, not an effect). Each pose has an _orig line.
