## Every number and colour of VFX's effects, in one place (docs/vfx/plan.md). Placeholder values until Art's palette
## roles land; every colour is a semantic role (trail rim, glass, steel, dust, crack line, lit lip) so Art can retune
## them without touching logic. Presentation only: nothing here is read by the sim.
