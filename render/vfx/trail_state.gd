class_name VfxTrailState
extends RefCounted
## One fighter's motion-trail state (docs/vfx/plan.md section 2): a short history of where it was, an eased speed
## intensity k, and the wind marks it has left in the world. Steps once per unfrozen sim tick from the fighter's own
## displacement, so it works for free flight, launches, slides and rushes alike. Reads the fighter; never writes it.
## Its random numbers come from the caller's cosmetic stream (vfx.trail), a fixed number of draws per tick.
