class_name VfxShots
extends RefCounted
## Energy blasts on screen (Encounter's slice 5, Simulation's docs/architecture/shots.md): the state behind what shots_view.gd draws.
## The shots themselves are drawn every frame straight from S.shots (position and velocity, interpolated; see the view). This keeps the
## rest: the short effects the shot events call for, and the charge on the hand while a charged shot is held.
##
##   shot_fire   a small muzzle flash (a ring) at the point of leaving
##   shot_hit    by outcome: hit (a flash and a ring), guard (a splash that fans back toward the shooter), deflect (a bigger ring in the
##               DEFLECTOR's colour: the shot itself is seen turning, because S.shots changes its owner and it flies back), shrug and
##               stop (a smaller flash), dodge (nothing at him: the shot flies on, and its end on the ground is the miss)
##   shot_clash  a trade: two rings, one in each fighter's colour, and a burst of eight short lines
##   shot_end    cause ground or water: the miss's puff of dust or a ring on the water (World's crater event, if any, comes by itself);
##               cause life: a small fading ring; hit and clash have their own
##   cue         blast_charge (a charged shot's charge starts, on the hand), blast_full (it is complete), blast_cancel, charge_stopped (gone)
##
## The charge on the hand is each fighter's own look and never a sphere in a palm, hands at a hip or a two-hand push (Legal, the first
## energy slice): the Anti-hero (a villain) has plates stacking along the forearm, one more each fifth of the charge; the others have thin
## rings stacking along the forearm. Both are in the lane colour (VfxAura.lane_color: never white, gold or red), at the forearm of the arm
## toward the rival, and fade when the shot leaves or is cancelled.
## On top of that (Orb, 2026-10-02: the blasts should "erupt into flame and smoke, explosive particles"): a shot's hits and ends are
## explosions (explode.gd: flame, sparks, smoke, thrown chunks, a flat ring and a smouldering scorch, by the shot's power and by where it
## goes off), a shot that has been knocked loose (`deflected` above zero) tumbles and trails smoke, and the mines of concept
## (hovering or on the ground; look only, no sim behind them yet) are kept here for the view to draw.
## Presentation only: it reads events and the fighters and draws no random number of its own (the pool's cosmetic streams do).
