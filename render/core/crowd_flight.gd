## Evacuation, seen: people who flee a blow run away from it and are gone. World's `evacuate` event {b, x, z, n, cx,
## reason, owner} (docs/world/collateral-caps.md section 5) comes in the same tick as the building's popAlive falls.
## The planet view hands over the figures that just vanished. This decides which of them run. From a building a blow
## hit this frame (its `debris` event: the sim's damage always throws it; or World's `building_hit` or `floor_hit`, a
## held hit into its floors, which throws none), as many run as the building's events have reported fled, farthest
## from the blow first; the rest, nearest the blow, were casualties and are simply gone.
## From a building no blow hit, everyone who vanished left on foot (people die only by damage), so they all run at
## once, even before the event that reports them (World reports a building's fled people in lots of half a person). Then it animates the runners on sim time (so pause and hit-stop hold them): away from the
## event's x at a run, faster the closer they were, and drifting back behind their own row's face; a share look back
## once; each fades out at the end of its run (RenderLook.RUN_*). People sheltering elsewhere (the event's `dest`) run
## to that building instead, into its street, and it shows them only as they arrive (`incoming`, `arrived`). Runners reuse their own
## crowd instances; the crowd shader draws the run cycle and the fade from the instance colour (g: 1 - run, a: fade).
## Render-side only: reads the sim and the events, never writes either.
