extends Node3D
## Greybox main scene: runs the GDScript sim as a 60 Hz fixed-step loop (SimHost) and draws it every frame,
## interpolated between the last two ticks, in a 2.5D side-on view of the wrapped planet. It starts as an AI-vs-AI
## demo; any key or click hands P1 to a human (as the prototype did).
##
## It hosts UI's HUD (ui/hud/ui_hud.tscn, docs/ui/hud-spec.md section 14) and Audio's voices (audio/, "Hooking it
## up"). Both read the sim and the events SimHost drains; neither writes it. F2 swaps in the greybox HUD
## (render/core/hud.gd) until UI's playtest, F3 shows the performance readout, F4 the director feed.
##
## Rendering never writes sim state: the views read S, the fx consumer and the reference camera, and only SimHost
## steps the sim. render/tools/determinism.gd checks that the gameplay hashes are unchanged by rendering.
##
## The world is drawn by panes (render/core/pane_world.gd). The game runs Camera's dynamic split screen by default
## (docs/camera/split-screen.md): main owns and steps its SplitRig (render/camera/split_rig.gd), and Camera's
## compositor (SplitView) attaches through make_pane, move_pane0 and `compositor`, so the panes follow the rig's
## cameras and UI's HUD gets the rig's record (split_fn). F9 toggles it, --nosplit starts with one view from the
## reference camera, and the tools (manual) get one view unless they attach a compositor themselves. The contract is
## in docs/rendering/README.md, "Panes and the split screen". SplitView follows UI's options each frame: split_solo,
## reduced_motion, and Camera's zoom, shake and launch-follow settings (F10 and F11 flip the first two).
## Alt+F9 steps the camera's pitch (RenderLook.PITCH_STEPS: straight on, Camera's raised side view, its three-quarter
## view; docs/camera/camera-v2.md section 8), and Ctrl+F9 swaps the occlusion method (a hole around the fighter, or the
## buildings in front cut down to stubs; docs/rendering/README.md, "Occlusion"). Neither takes P1 over (Alt and Ctrl
## are not game keys; Shift is). --pitch=DEG and --occl=hole|stub set them at start. --nostreets leaves the lane table's
## streets unpainted, --nodamage the fighters unmarked, --noclouds the sky bare, --skyreact the clouds parting at tier 3 and 4 (off by default) and --nowindows the buildings' walls blank (for A/B). Camera's inset pane comes from make_inset and the compositor's inset_view (below).
## Local two-player (docs/controls/local-two-player.md): SimHost takes the input hub's joins and leaves each tick. A
## join turns the split screen on if it was off; T makes P2 human or hands the slot back; the pause menu's entry hands
## it back at once. UI's HUD is told each player's device and layout every frame (_sync_players).
##
## The intro phase (docs/architecture/dynamic-intros.md): a match starts with an intro composed from its seed
## (_match_setup). --nointro starts from the intro's end state, and on the web /play/?nointro=1 does. SimHost passes
## intents on pre-clock ticks; any press skips it.
##
## Command-line options (after "--"): --seed=N, --human (take P1 at start), --legacy-hud, --frames=N (quit after N frames),
## --shot=path.png (save the last frame), --bench (vsync off; print frame-time stats at quit, also split by whether two
## full panes were drawn; VFX at a fixed quality), --novsync, --nosplit, --novfx (VFX off, for A/B runs),
## UI's How to play card opens at the first run and with F1 (the HUD handles the key) or from the pause menu (P, then
## How to play), and its feedback panel from the pause menu (Send feedback) or its match-end pill; the sim is frozen
## while either is open. --vfx-quality=0|1|2 (VFX's low, medium or high, fixed). F6 toggles VFX's ground cracks (on by default), Shift+F6 its
## destruction (shards, collapse dust, holes; off by default until B2), and while that is on the particles skip a
## building fall's dust and debris (SimHost._without_fall_debris), which VFX draws instead. Ctrl+F6 toggles VFX's scorch
## embers (on by default), which replace ImpactFx's scorch sparks while on.
## Head flashes (render/core/flash_view.gd): F7 on and off (on by default, in place of the placeholder aura), F8 the
## legacy shapes, Alt plus 1 to 9, 0, -, =, [ and ] fires each flash in the data's order on P1 (Shift: P2), Alt+F
## cycles a fighter's shape family (Shift: P2). The Alt keys never take P1 over. --flash-soak (for the bench) keeps
## flashes cycling on both fighters, one after another in the data's order.
## Benchmark: godot --path . --fixed-fps 60 --resolution 1280x720 -- --seed=4 --frames=4800 --bench
## (--fixed-fps 60 gives exactly one sim tick per frame; with vsync off each frame runs as fast as it can, so the
## wall-clock frame time is the true cost of one tick plus one rendered frame.)
