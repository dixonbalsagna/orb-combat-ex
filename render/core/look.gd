class_name RenderLook
## Greybox look: every colour and dimension the renderer uses, in one place. Placeholder values until Art's palette
## and the procedural generator specs land; then these move to data files. The biome, prop and HUD colours are the
## prototype's (prototype/index.html BCOL and draw*), so the greybox reads like the prototype.

## Camera: vertical field of view in degrees. The reference camera's zoom z (pixels per world unit) is honoured
## exactly on the fighter plane (depth 0); anything in front of or behind it gets perspective parallax.
const FOV_DEG: float = 30.0
## The camera pitches the debug key steps through, in degrees (CameraRig): straight on (today's view, which already
## sees the ground from about 6 degrees through its raised lens), then Camera's raised side view and its three-quarter
## view (docs/camera/camera-v2.md section 8). Camera's own constants replace these when its mapping takes the pitch.
const PITCH_STEPS: Array = [0.0, 11.0, 49.0]

## World scale. Sizes that belong to the world (buildings, trees, craters, the ground's depth) are written at the
## original scale and multiplied by the sim's feature scale WS; mountain heights by MS; lengths along the planet by PS
## (sim/core/constants.gd, docs/world/scale.md). Fighter-scale sizes (the fighter plane's fine rows, particles, the
## fighters themselves) are not scaled.
const WS: float = SimConst.WS

const Z_TERRAIN_FRONT: float = 600.0     # the ground's shading reference in front (its top face brightens toward here)
## The ground runs toward the camera and past it, so there is no front face to see at any zoom: Z_FORE is past the
## camera at its widest pull-out (SimCamera.ZOOM_MIN) on viewports up to about 3,500 px tall. In front of the fighter
## plane the foreground rule (ground.gdshaderinc, fore_fall) keeps land and water below the sight line from the camera
## to the fighter plane, less FORE_DROP of their depth: nothing in front hides the fight, the camera is never inside
## the ground or under water, and a ridge or sea the camera is below shows as a soft face under its own profile.

## Ground rows are generated, not listed: spacing ROW_STEP0 at the fighter plane (fighter scale), growing by
## ROW_GROWTH of the distance, from Z_FORE in front to the horizon (FOG_FAR) behind. The row at exactly 0 reads the
## sim's profile (render/core/ground_field.gd). Columns coarsen with distance from the fighter plane, either side:
## STRIDES is [up to this |z|, column stride]. The finest run and the middle runs are split into chunks along the
## planet (CHUNK_COLS columns) so the frustum culls them; the coarsest is one mesh per copy.

## Head flashes (render/core/flash_view.gd; Art's spec docs/art/flash-prototype-spec.md, data data/art/flashes.json).
## The layouts, timings, priorities, colours of the info flashes and Legal's rules are Art's data; these are the
## drawing's own numbers from the spec. Sizes are in layout units: a twelfth of the fighter's head size, the data's
## own unit. For Art's figures that is also the spec's hundredth of a body height; the placeholder's head is larger
## (a 20-unit head on a 90-unit body), so the head rule keeps every flash as Art drew it around the head.
const FLASH_UP: float = 2.0             # the flash's origin above the head centre
## The spec puts the flash just behind the head. The placeholder's hair crest is deep and would swallow it, so the
## flash draws in front (FLASH_Z) with the head's own disc cut out (never over the face). Glyphs rise by any excess
## of the head's radius over Art's (FLASH_ART_HEAD_R; none with the head unit).

## Staging (Orb: fighters "cheat out" like stage actors, docs/ep/vision.md). A fighter is turned toward the camera by
## a pose angle in degrees from a pure profile: TURN by state ("sliding" while a knockback slide runs), plus
## TURN_STANCE by stance when free or locked; the head leads by TURN_HEAD. A facing flip turns through facing the
## camera in TURN_TIME seconds; pose changes ease at TURN_RATE_DEG per second. Art tunes these (and a fighter's
## turn_scale) for its turnarounds.

## A hit the shared flash register refuses the white body for: the outline lights in this colour for HIT_FLASH_S (a

## The pan haze: while a pane's camera travels along the ground faster than PAN_HAZE_FROM screen widths a second, the
## buildings lose their windows and marks and melt toward the sky behind them, complete at PAN_HAZE_FULL, as far as
## PAN_HAZE_MIX. It comes in over PAN_HAZE_IN_S and clears over PAN_HAZE_OUT_S. A facade's window grid and its edge
## against the sky flip a great many pixels a tick when they sweep past; a jump of more than PAN_HAZE_CUT widths a
## second is a cut, not travel. It ships off (PAN_HAZE_DEFAULT): it is a large change to how a town looks in a rush,
## and Orb's to decide. --panhaze turns it on and --nopanhaze off, whichever the default is.
