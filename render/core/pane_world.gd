class_name PaneWorld
extends Node3D
## One camera's view of the world (docs/camera/split-screen.md section 11): the camera rig, the planet, the fighters,
## the beams, the particles and the sky, and the per-camera material state they draw with (RenderMats). The main
## scene holds one in its own world. Camera's split screen puts two in SubViewports with a World3D each
## (main.gd make_pane and move_pane0).
##
## The first pane runs the world's render-side logic: the ground uploads, the props, the flight and the startle, and
## the head flashes' state machines with their hooks to Audio and UI. A second pane has it as its `source`: it shares
## the planet's meshes, ground data and props, and its fighters' flashes follow the first pane's. Its own nodes and
## materials carry its camera (the floating origin, the curvature, the sky, the fore rule, the crowd's boost, the
## fighters' anchors), so a second pane costs nodes and draw submission, not memory or logic.

## Keep the fighters in view behind buildings, by this pane's method. Either way a building counts as in front of a
## fighter when it stands between this pane's camera and his chest, and the building a launched fighter is aimed at
## stays whole (its cut floors show him inside).
## The hole: a dithered circle around each fighter, cutting whatever of a building is nearer the camera than he is. It
## is always there, so a wall is eaten as he passes behind it and nothing pops. When both fighters are in view within
## HOLE_JOIN of the screen's width and buildings are in front of at least two of the three points (each fighter and
## the point between them), each hole stretches to the other fighter, so one opening shows both and the gap between
## them. A fighter behind a wall and one out in the open keep two round holes.
## The stub: the buildings near a fighter's sight line, and those in front of the stretch between two fighters in view
## together, sink to low stubs and stand again when no longer in the way.
