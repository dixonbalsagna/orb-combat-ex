class_name SimHost
extends RefCounted
## The game-side host of one sim: the fixed-step accumulator loop of docs/architecture/overview.md section 2, the
## keyboard state that becomes intents, draining the feed and fx outputs after each tick, and the two snapshots the
## renderer interpolates between. It is the only render-side code that calls into the sim, and it only does what a
## host must: step, toggle AI, start matches and drain S.out. Nothing it does depends on frame timing except how
## many ticks run per frame, so the tick sequence (and every gameplay hash) is the same at any frame rate.

const FEED_KEEP := 40

## After every tick, with the tick count (render/tools/determinism.gd hashes on it).
signal ticked(n: int)
## Every tick, with that tick's fx events and new feed lines, just before S.out is cleared: the hook for other
## render-side readers (UI's HUD). Listeners only read.
signal drained(events: Array, lines: Array)
## A player joined or left: {kind: "joined" | "left", slot, device} (UI's "P2 joined" line), from the input hub.
