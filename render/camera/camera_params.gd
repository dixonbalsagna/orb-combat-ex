class_name CamParams
## Every number of the dynamic split screen (docs/camera/split-screen.md), in one place. Screen fractions are of the
## screen height (vh) or width (vw) as named; times are seconds on the fixed 60 Hz step; distances are world units.
## Defaults marked "Orb decides" in the design doc are the ones a playtest will change.
