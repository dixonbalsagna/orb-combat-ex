class_name CameraRig
extends Camera3D
## Turns the reference camera (world x, y and zoom z in pixels per world unit, sim/core/view/camera.gd) into a 3D
## perspective camera. With no pitch it looks straight down -z and the mapping is exact on the fighter plane (z = 0):
## a point there lands on the same pixel as the prototype's w2s(), sdx(cam.x, x) * z + vw / 2 across and
## vh * 0.7 - (y - cam.y) * z down.
## Everything is placed relative to the camera's wrapped x, so the camera itself always sits at x = 0 (floating
## origin): no large coordinates, and the wrap seam is invisible to the GPU.
##
## Pitch (docs/camera/camera-v2.md section 8) raises the camera and tips it down by that angle, orbiting the point of
## the fighter plane at the screen's centre: that point stays at the centre at the same distance, so the zoom across
## holds there. Heights on the plane then draw cos(pitch) as tall, and a point w units behind the plane moves up the
## screen by about w sin(pitch) zoom. The closed-form mapping above holds only at pitch 0; with a pitch, map through
## unproject_position().
