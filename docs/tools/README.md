# Tools: CI, setup and the web build

Owner: Tools and Pipeline. Free GitHub-hosted runners only, no secrets beyond the built-in Pages token permissions, no paid services.

## One-command setup

From a fresh clone:

| System | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| Windows | `tools\setup.cmd` (wraps `tools/setup.ps1` and bypasses the execution policy for that one run) |
| Linux, macOS | `sh tools/setup.sh` |

It checks, in order:

1. **Node** (required). Missing or older than 18: it stops with exit 1. Any major other than 24 gives a warning, because the golden hashes were recorded on Node 24.19.0 and are skipped on other majors (ADR 0004), so a pass proves less.
2. **npm** (required, ships with Node).
3. **Godot** (optional today). Looks for `$GODOT`, then `godot` and `godot4` on the path (Windows also tries the `Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64*.exe` names). Warns if it is missing, is not 4.7.x, or is the .NET build (ADR 0001: standard build, GDScript).
4. **npm dependencies**: `npm ci` in the root, `prototype/`, `sim/` and `qa/`, only where a `package-lock.json` exists. Today only `prototype/` has one: it installs `@napi-rs/canvas` 1.0.9 (optional, MIT), which `prototype/tools/screenshot.js` needs to write a real PNG. The suites do not need it.

Exit 0 means ready, warnings allowed. Exit 1 means a required tool is missing or an install failed. Then run `node qa/run-all.js --quick` (about 40 s) or `npm test --prefix sim`.

## Data validation

**A schema without cases fails the data job.** The self-test (the first step of the data job) requires every schema in `tools/schemas/map.json` to have a valid document and at least three invalid cases in `tools/fixtures/cases.json`, so a schema patch that comes with no cases turns the job red even when `node tools/validate.js` shows 0 errors. A director who hands in a schema patch routes it through Tools and Pipeline before it is applied, with its cases and cross-checks.

`node tools/validate.js` checks every data file against its JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) and then the cross-references between files. Node built-ins only, no install, deterministic (no clock, no random), about half a second.

| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `node tools/validate.js` | Everything under `data/`, `audio/data/` and `ui/data/`, plus the cross-references. Exit 0 if there are no errors (warnings allowed; a missing or empty data folder is fine), 1 on any error, 2 on bad usage |
| `node tools/validate.js <paths>` | Only those files or folders, schema and lint checks only. Add `--xref` for the cross-references too |
| `node tools/validate.js --self-test` | Proves the validator can fail, and on the right rule (see below) |
| `node tools/validate.js --list` | Prints the folder-to-schema map |

Every finding names the file, the line, the JSON pointer and the rule, for example `error  data/combat/finishers.json:155 /finishers/3/beats/8/args/bark  [type] must be string (got boolean)`. A JSON file in a folder with no schema (for example `data/director/`) gives a warning, not a failure.

**What is checked**
- **Per file:** it must be strict JSON (no comments, trailing commas, byte-order mark), with no duplicate key in one object (`JSON.parse` and Godot silently keep the last) and no number with more than 15 significant digits (so JavaScript and Godot read the same double; `docs/architecture/d1-roster-data.md` section 4). Then the schema.
- **Schemas** (`tools/schemas/`, one per data family, listed in `map.json`): each has a version field (`schema` or `version`, pinned by `const`) and states its policy in its description. The policy everywhere: objects are closed (an unknown key is an error) except keys starting with an underscore, which are comments and are ignored by the canonical data hash; free-form synth or option tables are open with typed values.
- **Cross-references** (`tools/lib/xref.js`), each an error unless noted:

| `launch-setup` | data/director/launch.json setup.weight: a key that is not a decisive kind (launch, clash, guard_break, interrupt, knockback, beam, beam_clash, blast, barrage), default, blurPlain or barragePlain is a warning (it would never be read) |
| `blast-shot-kind` | data/director/interrupts.json blast: the light and heavy kinds are shot kinds of data/fight/shots.json; a heavy kind that trades with less power than the light one is a warning (and holdMaxTicks below chargeTicks is an `interrupts-order` error) |
| `blast-mine-kind`, `blast-spray` | data/director/interrupts.json blast: the mine's kind is a kind of data/fight/shots.json with a mine block; the spray's slopeMin is at most slopeMax, and a missShare above 1 is a warning |

| `fighter-id`, `roster-id`, `increasing`, `family-weights`, `fighter-files` | a fighter's id equals its folder and is unique; every roster id has a `fighter.json`; wound stages and ladder thresholds strictly increase; family weights match the region count; each fighter has `wounds.json` |

**Input schemas (ADR 0008, `docs/controls/input-schema.md`).** `input-actions`, `input-layouts` and `input-timing` are adopted for `data/input/`; the files do not exist yet, so the self-test uses the proposal's samples as neutral fixtures (`tools/fixtures/virtual/data/input/`). `input-feel` and `data/input/feel.json` stay mapped until Controls removes that file (timing.json supersedes it). The player's `user://input.json` is not in the repo and has no schema here. Three places where the proposal contradicted its own samples, resolved as follows (Controls to confirm): (1) the Simple presets reach heavy and signature through the `upgrade_heavy` and `upgrade_sig` gestures, so those count as binding them; (2) keyboard presets bind no `pause` (its keys are reserved), so `pause` is required for pad and touch only; (3) no touch preset had `default: true`, so the fixture marks `touch-simple` default (`layout-default` needs one per device).

**Draft schemas, fight level.** `fight-mood` and `fight-style` are drafts from `docs/architecture/mood-style.md` and Narrative's `docs/narrative/style.draft.json`; the data lands with Simulation's M1, whose commit tightens them. `combat-styles` is written from the file (design data, not yet loaded), so its overlays and chain beat lists are open objects until the loader lands. `input-feel` is Controls' proposal (`docs/controls/feel-schema.md`) adopted as written, with one fix: the hit-stop map takes underscore comment keys like every other object. Its underscore idiom (`additionalProperties: false` beside `patternProperties: {"^_": true}`) is exactly how every schema here expresses "closed except underscore keys"; the engine has no flag or keyword for it. For folders whose data does not exist yet (\`data/fighters/\`, \`data/fight/\`, \`data/input/\`) the self-test uses neutral fixtures under \`tools/fixtures/virtual/\`.

**Fighter schemas (D1a as built).** `fighter`, `fighter-wounds`, `fighter-meters` and `fighter-roster` follow `docs/architecture/d1-roster-data.md` sections 3 and 7b and validate the real `data/fighters/` files: wounds are closed with the ten penalty keys, the stricter brink (`brinkLimbs`), the act-1 damping and the overtime ramp; meters have the anguish and menace shapes (sources casualty and evacuee, four effect keys with the fields each needs); a fighter's identity carries Narrative's six optional keys (tagline, blurb, voice_device, voice_bible, pronoun, placeholder); the roster is a bare array or {"schema": "roster/1", "order": [...]}. `fighter-ladder` is still a draft (D1b guesses its field names). A new key in any of these files needs its schema line in the same commit.

**Self-test** (`tools/lib/selftest.js`, about 300 checks): the strict parser agrees with `JSON.parse` on every data file; every schema keyword the engine supports passes and fails as it should (`tools/fixtures/engine-cases.json`); every schema file uses only supported keywords, resolves its `$ref`s and is used; and about 90 invalid-data cases (`tools/fixtures/cases.json`) each mutate real data and must produce the named finding, at the named pointer, that the unmutated data does not. Every schema must have a valid document and at least three invalid cases. Fighter data does not exist yet, so the self-test uses neutral fixtures (`tools/fixtures/virtual/data/fighters`: `FIXTURE_HERO`, `FIXTURE_VILLAIN`) and ignores any real `data/fighters`. If a case fails with "fixture path missing", the data's shape changed: update the case.

**Engine.** `tools/lib/schema.js` is a small validator of our own that implements only the keywords the schemas use and rejects a schema that uses any other, so a constraint can never be silently ignored. The trade-off against a library such as ajv: no dependency, no install step, no lockfile, no Legal register row, and it is trivial to keep identical on any runner; the cost is that we maintain about 250 lines and a new keyword needs a line of code and a test case. It is JavaScript, not GDScript: it runs in CI without downloading Godot. The loaders' own checks stay in GDScript.

**Adding or changing a schema**
1. Write `tools/schemas/<name>.schema.json` (draft 2020-12, a version field, a "Policy: ..." sentence in the description).
2. Add a rule for its files to `tools/schemas/map.json` (first match wins).
3. Add at least three invalid cases to `tools/fixtures/cases.json` (and a virtual valid document under `tools/fixtures/virtual/` if no real data exists).
4. Cross-references go in `tools/lib/xref.js`, with a case each.
5. Run `node tools/validate.js --self-test` and `node tools/validate.js`.

Data files are owned by their directors; the validator reports problems and never edits data.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push, pull request and manual run, on the pinned image `ubuntu-24.04` (not `ubuntu-latest`, so a GitHub image migration cannot change a result without a commit):

| Job | Runs | Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `qa` | `node qa/run-all.js` (Node 24.19.0) | about 35 s |
| `sim` | `npm test --prefix sim` (Node 24.19.0) | about 1.5 min |
| `data` | `node tools/validate.js --self-test`, then `node tools/validate.js` (Node 24.19.0): schemas and cross-references | about 15 seconds (the self-test took 4.5 minutes until 2026-10-06; see below) |
| `godot-parity` | Godot 4.7.2 headless: import, GDScript parity, render determinism, render seam sweep | about 1 min |
| `flash` | the photosensitivity check, half 1 (docs/tools/flash-check.md): the analysers' and the headless-Chrome pipeline's self-tests, then the worst cases played headless in normal and reduced-flashing mode and the flash register's log recounted (more than 3 flashes in 60 ticks, 1 under reduced flashing, fails), then a negative control that must fail. Gates the deploy (it ran green on a real runner twice, then joined `deploy.needs`) | about 3 min |
| `site` | Godot Web export, then assembles the Pages site (`tools/build-site.mjs`) | about 2 to 3 min (the 1.28 GB templates download dominates) |
| `deploy` | Publishes the site to GitHub Pages. Only on push (or manual run) on `main`, and only after the six jobs above pass | seconds |

The first five run in parallel (the `flash` job too: three of them use Godot, `godot-parity`, `flash` and `site`; the cap is six). There are no npm install steps because the suites use Node built-ins only; CI runs without `@napi-rs/canvas` and the golden hashes match with and without it (the runner never calls `render()`). Add `npm ci` (with a lockfile) the day a suite grows a dependency.

Settings: `permissions: contents: read` (only `deploy` adds `pages: write` and `id-token: write`, the built-in Pages token permissions), no secrets, `persist-credentials: false` on checkout, a timeout on every job. A newer push cancels an older run of the same branch, except on `main`, where every run finishes so a deploy is never cut off.

### Pinned actions

| Action | Version | Commit SHA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `actions/checkout` | v7.0.1 | `3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1` |
| `actions/setup-node` | v7.0.0 | `820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020` |
| `actions/upload-pages-artifact` | v5.0.0 | `fc324d3547104276b827a68afc52ff2a11cc49c9` |
| `actions/deploy-pages` | v5.0.1 | `368f82528645a54fb793d4d04e342629a3f51346` |

All are first-party GitHub actions. To bump one, look up the tag's commit (`gh api repos/actions/checkout/git/ref/tags/<tag>`; if the type is `tag` rather than `commit`, follow it once more), replace the SHA and the version comment together, and update this table.

### The Godot jobs and the pinned download

Both Godot jobs use the local action `.github/actions/setup-godot`, so the pin lives in one place. It downloads the official Godot 4.7.2 Linux build (standard, not .NET) from the GitHub release and verifies its SHA-512 (from the release's `SHA512-SUMS.txt`) before running it, then sets `GODOT`. With `web-templates: 'true'` it also downloads `Godot_v4.7.2-stable_export_templates.tpz` (1.28 GB), verifies its SHA-512, and unpacks only the single-threaded Web templates (`web_nothreads_release.zip` and `_debug.zip`, about 20 MB). Nothing binary is committed. To bump Godot, change the version and both checksums together in that file and update this page.

`godot-parity` runs, from the repo root (`project.godot` is there): `--import` (registers the `class_name` scripts on a fresh clone), then `sim/core/tools/parity.gd`, `render/tools/determinism.gd` and `render/tools/seam_sweep.gd -- --size=1280x720`. Each exits 0 on pass. The `.godot/` import cache is created on the runner only (it is in `.gitignore`). The `sim` job does not set `GODOT`, so `npm test --prefix sim` skips its own godot stage there and the parity check runs once.

### Web export and the Pages site

`export_presets.cfg` (repo root) holds two presets:

- **Web**: Compatibility renderer (from `project.godot`), single-threaded, no extensions, so it needs no cross-origin isolation and runs on GitHub Pages as it is. Default output `build/web/index.html`.
- **Windows Desktop**: x86-64, pck embedded in one `.exe`, default output `build/win/orb-combat-ex.exe`. Not built in CI. The engine's Windows export template is in the same 1.28 GB download, so adding it later is a small change.

Both exclude `prototype/`, `qa/`, `research/`, `docs/`, `tools/` and `.github/` from the pack. Locally (with the 4.7.2 export templates installed):

```
godot --headless --path . --import
godot --headless --path . --export-release "Web" build/web/index.html
node tools/build-site.mjs --web build/web --out build/site
```

The `build/` folder should be in `.gitignore` (the EP's file). Serve `build/site` with any static server to try it; the web pack was about 0.6 MB and the wasm 39.5 MB (about 10 MB gzipped, which Pages applies).

**Build info for the feedback report.** `node tools/write-build-info.mjs` writes `build_info.json` at the repo root (`res://build_info.json`) as `{"commit": "<sha7>", "date": "<yyyy-mm-dd>"}`: the commit from `--commit`, then `GITHUB_SHA`, then `git rev-parse`, and the date is that commit's own date (`git log -1 --format=%cs`), never the clock. With no git it writes `"unknown"` and still exits 0, so a local build without git does not break. CI runs it before the web export. The export presets pack it through `include_filter="build_info.json"`; an export without the file still succeeds (the game must treat a missing file as unknown, as it does in the editor). The file is not under `data/`, so the sim hash never sees it, and `/build_info.json` must be in `.gitignore` (the EP's file). For a local web export, run the script first.

`tools/build-site.mjs` lays out the site: `/` a small landing page, `/play/` the Godot build, and `/bench/` (below), which the landing page does not link. The original prototype (`prototype/index.html`) is **not published**: it shows placeholder names and "AI" to a player, and Legal holds promotion of the site while they show; the file stays in the repo, untouched. It fails if the export folder has no `index.html` and `.wasm`.

**The band prototype at `/band/`.** Research's option B prototype (`research/band-proto`, a standalone Godot project with its own export preset) is exported in CI and hosted at `/band/` with `build-site.mjs --band <dir>`. When its engine files (`index.wasm`, `index.js`) are byte-identical to `/play/`'s (the same Godot 4.7.2 and web templates) the site ships only its `index.html` (patched to load the engine from `../play/` and its own `mainPack`) and its `index.pck` (about 37 KB), so there is no second 39.5 MB wasm; otherwise the whole export is copied. It is a throwaway page: not linked from the landing page, and never validated or run through the sim checks (the validator scans only `data/`, `audio/data/` and `ui/data/`).

### The bench page and the old-laptop range

**`/bench/` (one click, the real number; offline, and showing the notice, while `tools/site.json` says so).** `https://dixonbalsagna.github.io/orb-combat-ex/bench/` runs the same web build (loaded from `/play/`, so the site carries one copy of the 39 MB wasm) with the bench arguments baked in: fixed 60 Hz steps, seed 4, 2400 frames, vsync off. It shows a results panel and a "Copy result" button; the copied text holds every bench figure (frame ms mean, p50, p95, p99, max, draw calls, sim tick), the build (short commit), the browser, cores, memory, screen, window and the unmasked WebGL renderer. Someone with an old laptop opens the link, leaves the tab visible for a minute or a few, and pastes the text back. It is not linked from the landing page and is marked noindex. Options in the URL (combine with `&`): `?nosplit`, `?novfx`, `?noragdoll` (the animation overhaul off), `?noclouds` (the sky bare), `?anim-quality=high|medium|low|minimal` (an animation quality level; any other value is ignored), `?frames=N`. `build-site.mjs` fails the build if the Godot page template changes shape (it patches the exported `index.html`), so a Godot upgrade cannot silently ship a broken page.

**Keys while the canvas has lost focus.** The export preset's `head_include` also holds a small `keydown` guard: when the canvas is not the target (the player clicked the page around it), the space bar, the arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End no longer scroll the page. It leaves alone any key with Ctrl, Alt or Meta held (browser shortcuts), and any key typed in an input, textarea, select, button or link (so the bench page's Copy button still works from the keyboard). It takes effect at the next web export.

**`tools/bench-web.mjs` (a range on your own machine).** It serves a built site (`--dir`) or takes a URL (`--url`), and runs the `/bench/` page in fresh Chrome or Edge profiles: an unthrottled baseline, then each `--cpu-throttle` factor (default 4,6) using Chrome's CPU throttle, and with `--floor` a software-rendering (SwiftShader) run. It prints a table and a range, and writes every run to `--out` as JSON. About 4 minutes for baseline, x4, x6 and the floor at 1200 frames.

```
node tools/build-site.mjs --web build/web --out build/site
node tools/bench-web.mjs --dir build/site --cpu-throttle 4,6 --floor --frames 1200 --out build/bench.json
```

Read the result as a range, never a measurement. The throttle slows the browser's CPU work (the wasm simulation and the engine building draw calls), which is the likely limit for this game, but not the GPU, memory or a hot laptop; SwiftShader is a GPU-free floor far worse than any real laptop. First run (2026-09-29, Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Chrome 154, 1366x768, 1200 frames): baseline 3.1 ms mean (p95 3.8), x4 10.3 (p95 16.3), x6 17.3 (p95 26.2), SwiftShader 145. So a machine six times slower on the CPU side would miss a 60 fps frame at p95; the real old-laptop number from `/bench/` decides whether that is a worry.

### Switching Pages to GitHub Actions (a repo setting)

Today Pages is "Deploy from a branch" (`main`, `/`), served by GitHub's own `pages build and deployment` workflow. The `deploy` job cannot publish until the source is "GitHub Actions". The exact change:

- Web: repository **Settings, Pages, Build and deployment, Source**: change "Deploy from a branch" to **GitHub Actions**.
- CLI: `gh api -X PUT repos/dixonbalsagna/orb-combat-ex/pages -f build_type=workflow`

Order: push the workflow first (the tests and `site` job run; `deploy` fails harmlessly while the source is still a branch). After Orb agrees, flip the setting, then re-run the failed `deploy` job (or start CI by hand on `main`) so the site goes live at once. The site then serves only `/`, `/play/`, `/bench/` and `/band/`: other repo files that the branch source used to publish at their paths (for example `/docs/...`) are no longer served. Switching back is the same setting in reverse.

### What is and isn't proven

- **Proven on GitHub:** `qa`, `sim` and `godot-parity` (parity only, before the render checks were added) have passed on `ubuntu-latest` (before the runner pin to `ubuntu-24.04`, the same Linux family), so the golden hashes hold across OSes.
- **Proven locally only:** the render checks (determinism 11 s, seam sweep 1 s), the Web and Windows exports, and the assembled site (loaded in a browser: title "Orb Combat EX", the greybox match runs). The template download and unpack, the Pages artifact and the deploy have not run on GitHub yet; the first run on `main` is the proof.
- **Branch protection** is available (the repository is public) but not needed while only the EP commits.

## The offline switch (2026-10-06, Orb's order)

The public site serves **no playable build** while `tools/site.json` says `"offline": true`: `tools/build-site.mjs` then writes one plain notice page (the words are in `tools/site-notice.json`, Legal's RL-121 text, edited in that one place; the page is rendered by `tools/site-notice.mjs`: static HTML, no script, no external request, no description, keywords, og: or twitter: tag, noindex, dark, system fonts) as `/index.html`, `/play/index.html`, `/bench/index.html`, `/band/index.html` and `/404.html` (so every old path lands on it), and **copies nothing of the export**: no `.wasm`, `.pck`, script, manifest or icon. CI still does the web export and every check on every push, so a broken export still fails; only what is published changes. The `site` job's step "Check the offline site holds no game" runs `node tools/check-site-offline.mjs --site <dir>`, which fails if the output holds anything but those five pages, a `.wasm` or `.pck`, a script, an external address, a missing `noindex` or a page that is not the notice. **To bring the site back (Legal's list, accepted by the EP): set `"offline": false` and `"approved"` to the date of Orb's word in `tools/site.json`, and have a recorded full-set pass of the pixel check for the commit** (`tools/flash/release-pass.json`, written by `node tools/flash/release-pass.mjs --record --summary <run-pixels summary.json>` after a passing full run on a clean export of the commit). `tools/build-site.mjs` refuses to build the playable site otherwise (`--local` skips both for a local test and is refused on GitHub Actions), and says which check failed. Our own tools use local exports only (`tools/bench-web.mjs --dir`, `tools/flash/capture-web.mjs --dir`, `run-pixels.mjs`, `check-clip.mjs`, Rendering's hook): nothing of ours fetches the live `/play/`.

## Held for now

CONTRIBUTING.md, the pull request template and any licence field or licence check are on hold while Orb reconsiders the licence.

**Why the self-test is fast, and what keeps it so.** The self-test runs every data case (about 3,800) by mutating a copy of the data in memory and running the whole validator on it. It took about 1.2 seconds per 15 cases (278 s for 3,843 cases) because each case (1) re-checked every document against its schema, though a case changes one file, and (2) re-read every `.gd` and `.js` file under `sim/` for the `hash-anim-read` rule (122 s of the 147 s profiled). Now `tools/lib/selftest.js` works out the schema findings of the untouched documents once and re-checks only the mutated ones, and `tools/lib/xref.js` scans `sim/` once per process. Cross-references still run over the whole mutated set for every case. On a clean export of HEAD (4,783 checks): 278 s before, 11 s after, and the findings of all 3,842 mutation cases are identical, checked case by case. A rule that reads files must read them once per process, not once per call.
