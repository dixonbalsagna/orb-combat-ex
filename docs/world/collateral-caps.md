# The collateral cap and the casualty ramp: how they are built

Owner: World and Environment. Status: plan, docs only (2026-09-29); built after Encounter's S2, in the same sim window as B1. The numbers are Game Design's (`docs/design/balance-targets.md` §4b); this note is the mechanism.

**What has to be true.** After the scale window, the villain mirror loses 61% of the civilians (10.5% of matches lose 90% or more) and the default arm's low-tier bleed is 19.9% of the population per minute. Game Design's rules: a rolling 60 s budget by the higher fighter's tier, a cumulative ceiling by the highest tier reached, set-piece borrowing at tier 3 and above, and every per-casualty gain normalised by `425 / pop0`. Over budget, people evacuate instead of dying, and structures still take their damage. It has to apply to every source, and evacuation has to read as people fleeing, not as immortal civilians.

## 1. One choke point

Every civilian death today goes through `damageBuilding` (`dead = min(popAlive, pop * frac * 1.3)`, then everyone left when the building falls) into `WorldStructures.casualty`. Impacts, blasts, beams, slides, launch collisions, brunts and chains all reach it through `damageArea` or `damageBuilding`. Later hazards (fire, landslides, quakes, lava, floods) will reach it the same way if they damage buildings, and through a new call if they hit people outside buildings.

The rule that makes the cap apply to everything:
- **No code counts a casualty except through `WorldCollateral.kill`.** `WorldStructures.casualty` becomes the private step that feeds the meters, and only `kill` calls it.
- `kill(S, b, want, cause)` is what `damageBuilding` calls in place of subtracting and counting. `want` is the number who would die. It removes them all from the building, counts the allowed number as casualties, and counts the rest as evacuated (section 4).
- Hazards outside buildings call `WorldCollateral.kill(S, null, want, cause)` with the position in an event, so they are capped the same way.
- A check in `probe.gd` (and a lint in the parity gate) fails if `casualty(` appears anywhere but `collateral.gd`.

New file `sim/world/collateral.gd` (`WorldCollateral`): the tables, `kill`, `beginEvent` and `endEvent`, `tick`, and the readouts. Structures keeps `damageBuilding` and `damageArea`; it just delegates the deaths.

## 2. The rolling budget

- **The limit.** In any rolling 60 s, casualties may not exceed `budget = BUDGET[tier - 1] * pop0`, where the tier is the higher of the two fighters' tiers at that moment and `BUDGET = [0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.15]`.
- **The window.** 60 buckets of one second of match time each (a `PackedFloat32Array`), indexed by `int(floor(S.T)) % 60`. When the second advances, the buckets it skips are cleared. `cbSum` is the sum. Time is `S.T`, so hit-stop and the slow-motion after a KO do not count. Cost: a few operations per tick and 60 additions once a second.
- **Room.** `room = max(0, budget - cbSum)`. A casualty request `want` gets `min(want, room)` from the window.
- **Falling tier.** Tiers only rise, so the budget only rises; the window is never above a newly lower budget.
- **Set pieces borrow** (tier 3 and above only). See section 3.

## 3. Set pieces and borrowing

A set piece declares itself so that the casualties it causes can draw on its own allowance in addition to the window's room.
- `beginEvent(S, kind, cause)` sets `S.world.evtKind`, `evtLeft` (its per-event budget times `pop0`) and the fighter; `endEvent(S)` clears them.
- While an event is open at tier 3 or above, `kill` grants `min(want, room + evtLeft)`, taking from the room first and then from `evtLeft`. What it takes is added to the window, so `cbSum` can go over the budget. It stays over until the old buckets expire, so **nothing else can be killed until the window has refilled below the budget**: the average rate holds and the spectacle is paid for.
- At tier 1 and 2 borrowing is off: `evtLeft` is ignored, so a single event still has to fit in the room, and the low-tier band is firm.
- **Per-event allowances** (share of `pop0`; Game Design's rules in §5b, §5c and `living-destruction-numbers.md`):

| Set piece | Tier 3 | Tier 4 | Opened by |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| Brunt chain (`buildings-in-depth.md` 4b) | 12% | 20% | B2: the launch beat that starts the chain, closed at the last hit |
| Knockback slide | 5% | 10% | `WorldSlide.begin`, closed by `finish` or a cliff release |
| Landslide (LD2) | 5% | 10% (one collapse a match) | LD2 |
| Quake (LD3) | per its section, tier 4 only | | LD3 |

- A single brunt (one building) is not a set piece: it draws on the window only.
- **Scoping (EP ruling): the allowance belongs to the event's own source.** `beginEvent` returns a token (an integer, kept in `S.world.evtToken`), and the source passes it down: `damageArea` and `damageBuilding` take an optional `evt` argument, and `kill(S, b, want, cause, evt)` draws on the allowance only when `evt` equals the open event's token. A beam or a launch collision at the same moment has token 0 and can only use the window's room. The slide sets the token at `begin` and passes it in its path samples; a chain passes its token from the launch beat to each brunt; LD2 and LD3 do the same. `evtLeft` is cleared with the token at `endEvent`.
- **The planner.** The chain planner (B2) reads the room and `evtLeft` and drops a chain that would be over budget, as `buildings-in-depth.md` already says, so the plan and the outcome agree. `WorldCollateral.room(S)` is the shared readout.

## 4. The ceiling

- **The limit.** `S.world.casualties` may not exceed `CEILING[maxTier - 1] * pop0`, with `CEILING = [0.10, 0.30, 0.60, 0.90]` and `maxTier` the highest tier either fighter has reached so far in the match (`S.world.maxTier`, raised in `tierUp`).
- **Applied last.** `granted = min(want, room + evtLeft, ceilingLeft)`; the ceiling also limits borrowing, so a set piece cannot break it.
- At the ceiling the rest survive: they are sheltered, and count as evacuated with reason `ceiling`.

## 5. Evacuation: people fleeing, not immortal civilians

The design goal is that an over-budget blow visibly empties a place, so that the cap reads as a crowd escaping, never as civilians who take a hit and do not die.

**What the sim does.**
1. **The ones who would have died flee.** In `kill`, `want - granted` people are taken out of the building (`popAlive` falls by all of `want`), added to `S.world.evacuated` and reported with an `evacuate` event. They are alive and gone from that district for the rest of the match: they do not return, so the same building cannot be farmed for casualties again, and `popNear` and the AI see the emptier street (the hero's lure treats it as empty land; the villain finds less to feed on, which is the intended pressure).
2. **The district empties while it is over budget.** While `cbSum >= budget` (or the ceiling is reached), `WorldCollateral.tick` evacuates each standing building within `EVAC_R = 3,000 * WS / 8` units of the most recent heavy event (the last crater, slide sample, brunt or fall) at `EVAC_RATE = 0.30` of its remaining people per second. This is the visible flight: the people who were not hit run too, because the place is under attack. It costs a loop over the 91 buildings once per tick while over budget, and stops when the window refills. The rate is bounded (`EVAC_MAX_PER_TICK` events).
3. **Nobody is evacuated at random.** The pick is by distance to the event, nearest first, so the fleeing crowd comes from where the blow fell.

**What Rendering does (through the EP).** The `evacuate` event `{b, x, z, n, cx, reason, owner}` carries the building, the number who fled, the direction away from the event (`cx` is the event's x), and the reason (`budget` or `ceiling`). Rendering makes the figures that were at that building run away from `cx`, at a run, and fade or despawn them at the edge of the district or as they pass behind the row of buildings behind them; a stream of runners from a district that is being emptied reads as a flight. Figures for people still alive stay put. The number of figures follows `popAlive`, so when people evacuate the crowd thins. Suggested look: bunching at street corners, a few looking back; the closer to the event, the faster. A district that has been evacuated stays empty, with the occasional straggler.

**What Narrative does (through the EP).** Barks from the same event, by role: the hero relieved ("They're getting out"), the villain contemptuous or frustrated ("Run, then"; "Where are they going?"), and a narrator line for the first evacuation of a match. Reasons matter: `budget` is a moment ("the streets are emptying"), `ceiling` is a state ("there's no one left to lose"). A feed line once per district per minute.

**What the player must not see.** A person struck by a blast, alive, standing in a collapsing building. The rule is: people who would die are removed from the building in the same tick and appear as runners; buildings that fall do so empty of anyone who is over budget.

## 6. Normalising the meters

`CASUALTY_NORM = 425 / pop0` multiplies every per-casualty gain, so meters read the share of the population lost and planets of different sizes are equivalent (the scale window left 379 people on seed 1 against 425).
- In `casualty()`: menace `n * 0.9 * norm`, the villain's power `n * 0.09 * norm`, anguish `n * (0.9 if hero caused it else 0.5) * norm`.
- The roster's collateral-fed meters (the Cyborg's Hunger per civilian and his molt thresholds, and any later meter) take `norm` in the same place; the roster loader (D1) applies it, so data files state per-425-people values.
- `popNear`'s divisor (`POP_NEAR_REF`) already carries the scale factor; it does not take `norm`.
- The count `S.world.casualties` stays a raw head count. Every band is a share of `pop0`, so tools divide by it (they already do).

## 7. State, events and cost

- **State** (`S.world`, all in the hash): `evacuated` (head count), `cbBuckets` (60 floats), `cbSec` (the last second index), `cbSum`, `maxTier`, `evtKind`, `evtLeft`, and per building nothing new (`popAlive` carries it). `pop0` is unchanged.
- **Events:** `evacuate {b, x, z, n, cx, reason, owner}`, emitted only when a building's evacuees since the last event total at least half a person (`EVAC_MIN 0.5`) and at most `EVAC_MAX_PER_TICK` (12) per tick. `collateral_state` `{room, budget, ceilingLeft, over}` once a second for the UI and QA (the UI can show a subtle "the streets are emptying" cue, Game Design's and UI's call).
- **Cost:** the window is a few operations per tick; `kill` adds a few comparisons per building damage; the district loop runs only while over budget.
- **Determinism:** no draw from `S.rng`. All arithmetic is on fixed tables and the state above. The building order for the district loop is the array order, and the nearest-first pick uses distance with the index as the tie-break.

## 8. How it is tested (numbers QA can run)

1. **The window** (hard): over every 60 s window of every batch match, casualties at or below `budget(tier)` plus the borrowed amount of any open set piece. Outside set pieces they never exceed the budget, at every tier. A synthetic test drives casualties at 10 times the budget and checks the grant.
2. **The ceiling** (hard): the cumulative share never exceeds the ceiling for the highest tier reached; at tier 1 or 2 it can never exceed 30%.
3. **Borrowing** (hard): none at tier 1 or 2; at tier 3 and above one set piece can take at most its allowance, and the window then admits nothing until it refills.
4. **Low-tier bleed** (band, `balance-targets.md` §4): at most 4% of the population per minute while both fighters are at tier 2 or below, measured from the same casualty stream (this is now guaranteed by the 4% budget; the test guards a regression).
5. **The 90%-loss share** (band): at most 10% of game-scale matches; the testbed's 7% on the villain mirror is the acceptance test for this work (it is 10.5% today).
6. **Every source** (hard): a probe forces each source in turn (blast, beam sample, slide, launch collision, brunt, chain when B2 lands) at ten times its normal strength with the budget at zero, and checks casualties stay zero and evacuations account for the rest (`casualties + evacuated` equals what would have died).
7. **The choke point** (hard): no call to `casualty(` outside `collateral.gd`.
8. **Normalisation** (hard): with `pop0` doubled (a synthetic planet) the menace and anguish after the same share of the population lost are equal, to a tolerance.
9. **Evacuation reads** (Rendering and QA together): a district that has been over budget for 5 s has no figure standing under a blast; the number of runners equals the events' `n`.

## 9. Fit with the queue and open points

- **Slot:** the sim window after Encounter's S2, with B1: the cap needs `damageBuilding` in the state B1 rewrites (rows, rubble), and B1's `building_fall` events must carry the evacuated count. If B1 slips, the cap can go first because it touches only `structures.gd`, `damageBuilding`, `casualty` and `tierUp`.
- **Golden and QA:** one regeneration; the testbed's mean-at-KO band retires as Game Design says.
- **Encounter:** the planner's chain and slide scoring read `room` and `evtLeft`; the hero and villain AI can read `over` (a villain over budget has nothing to gain from a populated district and should leave; a hero can use the emptied districts).
- **Settled:** see the rulings below.
- **Rulings (EP, 2026-09-29):** evacuees never return; 30 percent a second stands in the sim and Rendering tunes the look; the source token above; `collateral_state` is emitted and the UI decides whether to show it (default: not shown).
- **Risk:** civilians can be seen to survive a hit if the crowd behaviour is late. The event is emitted in the same tick as the damage; Rendering must start the runners from that tick, not after.

## 10. As built (world window after S4)

Code: `sim/world/collateral.gd` (`WorldCollateral`), `sim/world/structures.gd` (`damageBuilding` delegates deaths to `kill`), `sim/world/slide.gd` (the slide's token and pop), `sim/core/fighter.gd` (`tierUp` raises `maxTier`), `sim/core/roster.gd` and `damage.gd` (data-driven anguish).
- As planned: the rolling window, the tier budgets, borrowing by token at tier 3 and above, the ceiling, `kill` as the only place a casualty is counted (checked by `probe.gd`: no `casualty(` or `_feed(` outside `collateral.gd`), meters times `425 / pop0`, the evacuate event in the same tick, unrounded for a blow's evacuees and in lots of half a person for the district flight, `n` a float head count (`FxEvent.n` is untyped now), `b`, `cx`, `reason`, and `collateral_state` once a second.
- **Anguish** belongs to every fighter with `hasAnguish` (roster data: KAI has it); the comeback and composure terms in `damage.gd` and the hero's lure in `ai.gd` use the same flag. A hero mirror gives each hero +0.9 for its own casualties and +0.5 for the other's.
- **The district flight is capped**: each building gives at most `FLIGHT_MAX` = 40 percent of its people to the flight over a match (`Building.fled`), or a long fight empties every district it touches.
- **Evacuees leave the count.** With `RELOCATE = false` (the default) the people who flee are gone from the planet's count for good, as ruled. With `RELOCATE = true` they take shelter in the nearest standing building 3,000 to 12,000 units from the event (at most twice its people), so the population is conserved; the `evacuate` event then carries `dest`. Measured over 20 matches the difference is small (12.4 against 16.0 percent lost).
- **Finding for Game Design.** The budget is not what limits the collateral in a full match; the early fight is. Fights start at the city's edge at tier 1 to 2, want is high there, and the window is over budget for the first two minutes (105 would-be deaths a match evacuate instead of dying); after that the fighters are usually elsewhere and there is little to kill. Utilisation of the budget (casualties over the integral of the budget) is 18 percent. The mean loss lands far below the 45 to 50 percent Game Design expected, so if that is wanted the tier 1 and 2 budgets, not the caps, are the lever.
- `probe.gd` covers the window (2 percent at tier 1, refill after 60 s), borrowing (only at tier 3 and above, only for the event's own token), the ceiling, normalisation, anguish, the choke point, every source at ten times strength with the budget spent (nothing dies, everyone removed is counted evacuated), the depth rows, the spatial index against brute force, implode and rubble.

## 11. Rulings applied (2026-09-30)

- **`RELOCATE` is on** (Game Design): evacuees take shelter in the nearest standing building 3,000 to 12,000 units from the event (at most twice its own people), so the population is conserved and only the budget limits deaths; the `evacuate` event carries `dest`. With no such building the people leave the planet's count.
- **Evacuee menace.** Each evacuee feeds the causing fighter's menace, `+0.45 * 425 / pop0`, when the fighter has a menace meter (`Fighter.hasMenace`, roster data: VORR). Anguish gets nothing from evacuees. The district flight has no causing fighter, so it feeds nothing.
- **`hasMenace`** replaces the `role == "villain"` test in the meters (`collateral.gd`, `damage.gd`, `fighter.gd`, `beam.gd`), so the meter belongs to the fighter's data, as anguish does.
## 12. C1 at tier 2: the window frees a second's kills up to a second early (2026-10-03, on df05b9f)

**The finding.** QA's hard test C1 failed on seeds 336 (default arm) and 268 (swap-flip) at tier 2. The per-event budget is not what overspends, and neither are the shots against buildings: **the rolling window itself gives back each second's casualties up to a second too early.** `collateral.gd` keeps 60 one-second buckets (`WINDOW_S` 60). At the first tick of second s the bucket of second s - 60 is cleared, so kills made late in second s - 60 (at s - 59.2, say) leave the window 59.2 s later. QA's test compares the count at the start of each second with the count 60 seconds earlier, which keeps them for the full 60 s (and one tick). The two differ by whatever was killed in the last fraction of the freed second.

**Seed 336, tick by tick (default arm, tier 2, budget 4% of 390 = 15.6 people).**
- T 84.77 (tick 5722): `clashWave` (`damageArea`, one heavy-clash shockwave) kills 5.17 people in one tick across 21 towers and a house. Allowed: the window had 7.8 of room.
- T 117.85 to 117.93: a beam (`sampleBeam`) fills the window to 15.60. From then on the sim grants nothing (rm 0), as it should.
- T 143.23 and 143.30: a tower brunt, two `building_hit`s (`hit` and its `_splash`) kill 2.0 + 1.0 + 0.22 in houses, filling the window again to 15.60 (the second splash is cut to 0.22 and the third to 0).
- **T 144.00 (tick 9476): the window advances to second 144, clears the bucket of second 84 (the 5.17 of 84.77) and the room reopens to 5.26.** `_contact` (a landing, `damageArea`) takes 5.26 of it in that tick (1.03, 1.05, 1.30, 0.30, 1.57 in five houses). The sim's window was fine by its own bucket reckoning. QA's window from second 84 to second 144 holds 5.17 + the rest = 20.9 people, 5.35% of 390, against 4%: over by 5.27 people, exactly the freed bucket.
- Why the tier 2 cap did not hold: it held, against a window one second shorter than QA's. It is not a tower's occupancy (the towers' 0.1 to 0.5 each are small and the total never passes the window's room), not two events in one tick, and not the shots from the last window (`hit`, `_splash`, `_contact`, `clashWave` and `sampleBeam` are the launches, clash and beam).

**Seed 268, swap-flip.** The same shape: at T 146.58 to 146.60 a brunt and its splash (3.4 people, 146.x), the window is filled by a beam at 205.9, and at T 206.00 the second-146 bucket goes and the beam takes 3.4 again. Over by 0.002 of the population (4.2% against 4%).

**The fix.** One number in `sim/world/collateral.gd`: `WINDOW_S` 60 to **61** (61 buckets: the current second and the 60 before it). A kill then leaves the window no earlier than 60 s after it, never earlier, so QA's window never holds more than the sim's. Code, not data (the window length is a constant of the module, as the budgets are); `docs/world/scratch-build/c1/window61.diff`. It changes the golden (the grants differ at the edge) and the state hash through the bucket array (61 floats, `hash.gd` already walks the array). Measured in scratch on df05b9f (`c1chk.gd`, QA's rule at tier 1 and 2):
- seed 336 default: C1 fails before, passes after; seed 268 swap-flip: fails before, passes after;
- 100 other seeds, default and swap-flip: no failure before, none after (the failure is a 2 in 3,200 event);
- per-tier rates before and after, default arm, 100 matches: casualties per minute 0.16, 1.19, 2.83, 5.35% at tiers 1 to 4 against 0.16, 1.19, 2.82, 5.28%; structures per minute 0.28, 1.68, 4.35, 9.44% against 0.28, 1.68, 4.46, 9.31%. Swap-flip: casualties 0.16, 1.18, 3.03, 5.28% against 0.16, 1.18, 3.01, 5.28%; structures 0.29, 1.60, 4.27, 9.15% against 0.29, 1.60, 4.27, 9.21%. The rates do not move: the window is at most one second longer.

**Applied (2026-10-04, on 828e32f):** `WINDOW_S` 61, one golden regeneration (the casualty grants differ at the window edge). On that build seed 336 default and 268 swap-flip: 268 failed before and passes after (336 no longer fails on this build either way: matches diverge after every slice); seed 89 fails C1 on the **mirror-hero** arm before and passes after (default arm 89 passes both). `npm test --prefix sim` 5 of 5, `probe.gd` 0 failed, render determinism passes.
