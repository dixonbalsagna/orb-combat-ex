# The intro phase: the crater-landing entrance and the staredown

**Since 2026-10-06 the phase plays a composed timeline.** The fixed sequence described below is now the classic template of `data/fight/intro.json` (what `"intro": true` plays, tick for tick). The composer, the record a setup passes, the three scenarios, the host's facts, the new events and the `waiting` state are in `docs/architecture/dynamic-intros.md`.

Owner: Simulation and Engine. Status: plan, docs only (2026-10-02). It answers Camera's ask in `docs/camera/rule-of-cool-shots.md` row 7: a skippable window before the clock, with four events.

## 1. What it is

A run of **pre-clock ticks** at the start of a match, built like a pause (`SimPause`): `SimCore.step` returns false, `S.T` stays 0 (`S.tick` still counts each of these ticks: `q10-pace-acts-pauses.md`, "The two clocks"), no input is consumed and nothing else in the sim runs. Inside it the sim plays a fixed timeline: each fighter falls from the sky and lands in a crater, they stare, the clock starts.

- **It is a match setting.** `newMatch`'s setup takes `"intro": true`. Without it a match starts as today, so the goldens, the batch and QA's harness do not change. The setup is in the replay header, so a replay plays the intro it was recorded with.
- **It is scripted, not simulated.** A fall is a closed-form path from `fall_from_y` to the ground over the fall's ticks; no flight physics, no draw. The fighter is in a new state, `intro`, in which `stepFighter` does nothing.
- **The landing is real.** At the touchdown tick the fighter is placed on the ground and World digs the crater (`WorldCrater.dig` with an entrance energy). The spots are the start positions, which are on open ground clear of every town, so there is no collateral.

## 2. The timeline (data, `data/fight/intro.json`, in ticks)

Camera's shot is about 5 s. Its beats become the data's defaults:

| Beat | Tick | Event |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| The intro starts; A's fall starts | 0 | `intro_start {dur, skip_ok}`, `entrance_fall {actor, x, y, z, fall_from_y, dur}` |
| A lands | 36 | `entrance_land {actor, x, y, z, fall_from_y, r}` |
| B's fall starts | 84 | `entrance_fall` |
| B lands | 114 | `entrance_land` |
| The staredown | 144 | `staredown_start {dur}` |
| The clock | 300 | `clock_start` |

- `entrance_fall` is an addition to Camera's four: it comes when a fall starts and carries the height and the fall's length, so Camera can frame the sky before the landing and not chase it.
- `r` is the crater's radius, from the dig.
- The file also holds the fall height and the entrance crater's energy. Tools adds the schema; the file joins the replay's data hash.

## 3. Skip

- **Any press skips.** On a pre-clock tick the sim looks at the intents passed to `step`: a press edge on any human slot (light, heavy, signature, guard, dodge, power or transform) skips. The recorder already records intents on every tick, frozen or not, so a skip replays with no change to the replay format. An AI slot never skips; a host showing an AI demo can skip by passing one intent.
- **A skip changes nothing in the fight.** The remaining landings are applied at once, in order (both craters dug, both fighters placed), then `clock_start` is sent. The state at the clock is the same whether the intro ran or was skipped; only the tick count differs.
- `skip_ok` is false for the first few ticks (data), so a press held from the menu does not skip.

## 4. State, hash, events

- `S.intro` (integers, hashed): `left` (ticks to the clock), `t` (ticks played), `landed` (a bit per slot).
- `Fighter.state` gains `intro`.
- Five events: `intro_start`, `entrance_fall`, `entrance_land`, `staredown_start`, `clock_start`.

## 5. Who does what

| Who | What |
| :--- | :--- |
| Simulation | `sim/core/intro.gd` (`SimIntro`), `S.intro`, the check at the top of `SimCore.step` (ahead of the pause), the setup key, the events, the parity checks |
| World | The entrance crater: its energy, and a check that the two spots are open ground. Camera asks for at least 900 units between them; `START_GAP` is 750 today (below) |
| Camera | The shot, from the events. It writes nothing |
| UI | The HUD hidden until `clock_start`; the skip prompt |
| Controls | Confirm "any press skips", and the host passing intents before the clock |
| Tools | The schema for `intro.json` |

## 6. Proof and goldens

- With no `"intro"` in the setup nothing changes: parity on the untouched goldens.
- One golden match and one replay with the intro are added (new vectors; the existing ones do not move), plus forced checks: the timeline's ticks, a skip at several ticks giving the same state at the clock, no input consumed, `S.T` at 0 until the clock.

## 7. Rulings (EP, 2026-10-02)

1. **`START_GAP` goes to 900 for every match,** in the intro slice, with one golden regeneration.
2. **QA's batches run the intro, skipped at once,** when the intro ships, so they measure the same opening as the game.
3. **Either player's press skips for both** (Camera's plan).

Order: after World's ground-contact slices (G2 to G5), before the last stand.

## 8. Prepared (2026-10-02)

Built and proven in a scratch copy of 3fca9ac and parked in `docs/architecture/pending/` (`intro.gd`, `intro.py`; the README has the steps and the proofs). As built: the module is `SimIntro`; the setup's `"intro"` is `true` (play it) or `"skip"` (apply its effects at once, with no pre-clock tick: for batches and probes); a fighter in the intro has the state `intro`; the crater is World's `WorldCrater.dig` with the data's `craterEnergy` (1.5 for now: World's number to tune). The state at the clock is identical whether the intro ran, was skipped at any tick, or was applied by the setup's skip (a parity check).

**The default (EP, 2026-10-02).** A setup without the key gets `"skip"`: the match starts from the intro's end state with no pre-clock tick, so the game, the batches, QA's harness and the goldens share one opening. `"intro": true` plays it (the host passes it once Camera, Animation, Rendering and UI are ready); `"intro": false` is the old flat start. A is the fighter on the left start spot, and the entrance craters have no owner.

**Effects during the intro (Rendering, 2026-10-02).** The `tick` mark on an intro tick says `frozen: false`: effects run at full speed, so the landing's dust settles, while the sim holds exactly as in a pause (no clock, no mood, no cooldowns, no input consumed, `step` returns false). A host tells an intro tick from a live one by the step's return value or by `S.intro.left`.

## 9. As built (2026-10-02, on 15be796, with World's ground contact on)

`sim/core/intro.gd` (`SimIntro`), `S.intro`, the check at the top of `SimCore.step`, `data/fight/intro.json` with Tools' schema, the five events, `START_GAP` 900. The setup's `"intro"`: absent or `"skip"` starts from the intro's end state, `true` plays it, `false` is the old flat start. The entrance craters are World's dig (kind impact, full vertical, energy 1.5, no owner: radius 196 units; World's `ground-contact.md` section 16 confirms both spots are open ground). A is the fighter on the left start spot.

**Proofs, in the tree:** the code passes parity on the untouched goldens (9 matches, 173,141 ticks); with `S.intro` and the events hashed, every light digest and tick count is identical; then the gap and the default change the opening and the goldens are regenerated. The parity check "the intro phase" holds the timeline's ticks, the sim standing still through it, the skip rules, the same state at the clock by every path, and a replay through a skip.
