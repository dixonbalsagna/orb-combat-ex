# Pending core slices

Owner: Simulation and Engine. Nothing in this folder is run by CI, the validator, the sim or Godot (`docs/` is hidden from Godot). It holds slices that are built and proven in a scratch copy and wait for the sim slot.

Nothing is pending as a script. Shots, the second round, was applied on cf0466f with both of its switches off (`docs/architecture/shots.md` sections 13 to 18), and `shots2.py` and `shots2_schema.cjs` are deleted.

**What is left of it is two data flips,** each a behaviour change with one golden regeneration, in `data/fight/shots.json`:

| Flip | When | Proven in scratch on 2c91129 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `"structures": false` to `true` (done in World's window, bc0adfe) | In World's window, with World's `WorldBlast.shotBuilding` as the body of `SimShots.hitStructure` (one line in `sim/core/shots.gd`, by grant) | 4 of 9 golden matches move; parity and determinism pass |
| `"scatter": false` (under `deflect`) to `true` | With Encounter's lines for agency-pass 15.2 (the free approach, the context deflect, the feed text), after QA's measuring | 7 of 9 golden matches move; parity, determinism and the loader check pass |

The 100-match figures for each are in `shots.md` section 18.

Game Design's section 17 code items (the fuse by cause, `chainR` at every tier, the wild flight's speed and its arc by band) were applied on a56187a (2026-10-03). Tools' schema for the renamed keys is Tools' own parked script, `docs/tools/pending/apply-shots.cjs`.

**A written plan, not a build:** `shots-events-and-kinds.md`: VFX's four event asks on `shot_end` and `mine_trip`, and the kinds rain, split and curve for the launch pair (ricochet later). For my next window in the sim tree.

Dynamic intros, the first cut, was applied on 648c637 (2026-10-06); the plan is now `docs/architecture/dynamic-intros.md`, as built, and its parked build is deleted.

**Notes, not a build:** `zip-and-brawl-core-notes.md`: short answers for Encounter's zip slice (the point rush, shots on the way out, the tackle's `held` state, exhaustion) and for brawl B1 (`DirS.brawlI`, and what can move or free a locked fighter).

**A written plan, not a build:** `fighter-split.md`: the rename of the roster ids to `PROTAGONIST` and `RIVAL`, every file that names the old ids and its owner, displayed names as one data file, the order for one window and one regeneration, and the risks.

What is asked of the core and not yet built is listed in `core-backlog.md`.
