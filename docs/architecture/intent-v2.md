# Intent v2: the input record for ADR 0008 (plan, reconciled and ruled)

Status: plan only (Simulation, 2026-10-01). No sim edits. Sources:
- `docs/decisions/0008-control-scheme.md`;
- Controls, `docs/controls/input-scheme.md` §3, §4 and §8;
- Encounter, `docs/director/control-scheme-plan.md` ("SimIntent fields needed", "Order");
- the EP's rulings of 2026-10-01 on this page's first draft (§4).

This page is the single agreed table.

## 1. The rule that divides the work (EP ruling 1)

- **Tap against hold always resolves in the layout layer**, outside the sim. A hold threshold, a tap that ended early, a swipe, a two-trigger chord: the layout turns each into an action before it becomes an intent. Layouts can then change without invalidating a replay.
- **Only timing that depends on the fight is in the sim.** That covers:
  - the perfect block against the wind-up;
  - the direction class against the opponent;
  - whether a fighter is threatened;
  - whether a request has already been started by the director;
  - whether a transformation is available.
- **An intent is the resolved action record** for one fighter for one tick. It is the only thing a replay or a network peer carries. The AI writes the same record.

## 2. The intent record

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mx`, `my` | int, −127 to 127 | the stick, quantised by the layout (ruling 2); the sim uses `/ 127.0` |
| `guard` | bool, held | guarding |
| `guardPress` | bool, edge | a fresh guard press this tick; the sim judges the perfect block from it |
| `dodge` | bool, edge | the dodge. Inside an exchange it is the cancel (ruling 3: no separate bit; the sim decides by context) |
| `sprint` | bool, held | sprinting (the layout sends it once the dodge hold passes its threshold); moving away, it is Escape |
| `power` | bool, held | the power layer, and channelling |
| `powerPress` | bool, edge | the power control went down this tick |
| `powerTap` | bool, edge | a power tap completed (released before the hold threshold) |
| `mode` | int: −1 auto, 0 physical, 1 energy | the piece family, sent every tick (ruling 5). Auto lets the director pick (Simple layout, mobile) |
| `light`, `heavy`, `sig` | bool, edge | attack requests, one exchange request each |
| `upgrade` | int, edge: 0, 1 or 2 | 1 heavy, 2 signature: the layout saw the hold or the swipe; the sim replaces this button's last request if the director hasn't started it |
| `special` | int, edge: 0 none, 1 to 7 | a loadout special (ruling 4: 3 bits). 1 to 3 today, 4 reserved for the Cyborg's revealed weapon, 7 the Simple layout's auto pick |
| `context` | bool, edge | the context action; the sim picks which by priority |
| `transform` | bool, edge | the layout's chord completed; the sim ignores it unless a transformation is available |

- **Held** fields are true on every tick the action is held. **Edge** fields are true on one tick.
- **Removed:** `stance`, `dash`, `charge`.
- **No direction or entry field.** The stick is the direction; the sim classes it (toward, neutral, away) at the press.
- **No burst field.** The burst is the sim's reading of the power edges: `powerPress` when the fighter is threatened, `powerTap` otherwise (Controls' rule). The layout can't know "threatened".
- **Same tick** (ruling 6): `power` held plus a request on one tick fires the special on that tick. The sim adds no latency rule.

**Host guarantees (Controls):**
- A press shorter than a tick is stretched to one tick with its edge.
- A release and re-press between two ticks gives one edge.
- A face press inside the power layer sets `special` or `sig` and clears `light`, `heavy` and `context` for that press.
- Presses made during a hit-stop freeze are kept by the layout and sent on the first live tick. `SimCore.step` already consumes no input on a frozen tick.

## 3. What the sim derives (I2, not I1)

Encounter's fighter state is derived from the record and the fight, and lands in I2 (EP):
- the request queue (up to 3, each with its weight, mode and entry);
- `guardSince`;
- the last dodge tick;
- `dodgeCool` and `burstCool`;
- `formReady`;
- the burst (from the power edges), with one flag, "burst already fired on this press" (Controls): when a threatened `powerPress` fires the burst, the `powerTap` that follows on release doesn't fire a second one. The flag clears on the next `powerPress`.

`f.stance` is then derived each tick, and the director snapshots it at exchange start as now:
- Guard: `guard` held;
- Escape: `sprint` and moving away;
- Dodge: a `dodge` within its window;
- Press: an attack pending or just pressed;
- Neutral otherwise. Until Combat and Game Design give Neutral its column, it reads as AGGRESSIVE.

Controls owns these rules in `sim/input`, and Encounter reads them. Simulation owns the fields, their hashing and the core lines (the tier-up gate, `stepFighter`'s reads of sprint and channelling).

The per-slot assists (`autoBurst`, `specialPick`, `perfectBlockAssist`) go in the replay header's `setup` in I2, next to `slots`, `names` and `flip`. `autoMode` isn't needed: `mode` −1 says it.

## 4. Where the lists differed, and what was ruled

| Point | Controls | Encounter | Ruled or picked |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tap against hold | the sim counts holds | implied in the host | **Layout layer** (ruling 1). Controls' §3 thresholds move to the layout; the record carries their results (`sprint`, `powerTap`, `upgrade`, `transform`) |
| Movement | float, steps of 1/16 | `mx` | **8 bits per axis** (ruling 2) |
| Cancel | the dodge press in an exchange | the dodge edge | **No separate bit** (ruling 3) |
| `special` | 0 none, 1 to 3, 4 auto | 0 to 2 | **3 bits, 0 to 7** (ruling 4): 1 to 3, 4 reserved, 7 auto |
| `mode` | an edge (toggle) with a cooldown | a state | **A per-tick field with −1 auto** (ruling 5). The toggle and its cooldown are the layout's |
| Dodge | `dodge` held plus `dodgePress` | `dodge` edge, `sprint` held | **`dodge` edge, `sprint` held**: follows ruling 1 (the hold threshold is the layout's) |
| Guard | `guard` held plus `guardPress` | `guard` held, `guardTap` edge | **`guard`, `guardPress`.** The edge is needed: a release and re-press between ticks can't be seen in a held bool |
| Burst | derived from the power tap rule | an edge field | **No field.** `powerPress` and `powerTap` are recorded; the sim picks by "threatened" |
| `upgrade` | 0, 1 or 2 | none | **Controls.** The layout sees the hold; the sim applies the replacement, which depends on the director |
| `transform` | held; the sim counts 30 ticks while available | an edge | **An edge** (ruling 1: the chord's timing is the layout's). The sim ignores it when nothing is available |
| `entry` | none | −1, 0 or +1 | **Derived** at the press (it depends on the opponent's side) |
| Fighter state | suggested | listed | **I2** (EP) |

**For Controls' redesign:** `input-scheme.md` §3 and §8 need to follow these: the hold counts move to the layout, the stick to 8 bits, `mode` to a per-tick value, `transform` to an edge, `special` to 0 to 7, and `dodge` held gives way to `sprint`.

## 5. Determinism and the record

- **Packed form.** `SimIntent.pack() -> int` and `unpack(int)`: one integer of 35 bits.
  - 8 each for `mx` and `my`;
  - 2 for `mode`, 2 for `upgrade`, 3 for `special`;
  - 12 single bits.

  It is well inside what JSON carries exactly. `unpack(pack(i))` is the identity, and `unpack` rejects a value outside a field's range.
- **State hash.** The intent fields are hashed in the table's order.
- **Replay format v3.**
  - Inputs are `[tick, slot, packed]`.
  - The header gains `intent: 2`, the intent schema version.
  - `play()` refuses another format or intent version with reason `format`.
  - v2 replays are not migrated: none are kept.
- **Stun and wounds.** `SimWounds.gateIntent` clears movement, the held states and every edge while stunned. Broken legs clear `sprint`, as they clear `dash` today.

## 6. Slices

| Slice | Owner | Content | Goldens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I1, transport** (next window, after World's terrain fixes) | Simulation | `SimIntent` gains the new fields next to today's `stance`, `dash` and `charge` (a superset, for one slice). `pack` and `unpack`. The hash list. Replay v3 with the intent version. The scripted-replay generator. Nothing reads the new fields | **Unchanged**, proved as before: with the new fields left out of the hash, the goldens reproduce; then one regeneration |
| **I2, consumption** (Encounter's step 1) | Controls for `sim/input`; Encounter for the director and the AI; Simulation for the core lines | The derived fighter state (§3) and the stance from the held states. `stepFighter` reads sprint and channelling in place of `dash` and `charge`. The AI writes v2. The tier-up gate, `formReady` and the placeholder transform. The assists in `setup`. `Exchange` gains `tpl` and `branch` (the template id and the branch id, two strings, hashed), so an interrupt (the perfect block, the reversal, a beam answer) can find its branch's `interrupts` block; `ex.tag` isn't a safe key | Regenerated: a behaviour change. QA's bands and the feel probe judge it |
| **I3, removal** | Simulation | `stance`, `dash` and `charge` leave the record. The intent version goes to 3; replays from I1 and I2 are refused | Regenerated (the hash list) |
| Encounter's steps 2 to 5 | Encounter, Controls, Combat | Counters by request; the queue; interrupt windows; entry and mode through the style applier | Each its own checkpoint |

**Also in the I1 window (tools only):** `sim/core/tools/batch.gd` caps a match at `MAX_STEPS` 43,200 ticks, which counts hit-stop ticks. About 1 match in 100 is cut off just before its KO and reported as a timeout. The cap becomes match time: `S.T` reaching 900 s (the S4 ruling's 15:00). `sim/director/tools/tempo.gd` has the same cap; it is Encounter's file, so the same change there is theirs or a granted line.

**Also in the I1 window: the "wired numbers change a match" check, made robust.** It has needed seed edits twice (World's B2 and the terrain fixes): a changed opening stops a seed reaching a beam clash, a power-up beside buildings or VORR's evacuees inside 6,000 ticks. The fix has two parts:
1. **A forced probe per wired number,** like the forced wound vectors. Each case builds the state its number needs and calls the code that reads it, then compares one result between the real data and the edited copy:
   - menace and anguish regen and decay through one `stepFighter` tick with the meter set;
   - `damage_mul`, the comeback, composure and the tier's damage step through `SimDamage.hit`;
   - the casualty and evacuee sources through World's collateral call, with a named cause;
   - beam power through the director's power function;
   - the ladder's fill, thresholds and speed through `stepFighter`;
   - the power-up area through `tierUp` beside a placed building;
   - the launch step through `doLaunch`;
   - the guard split through `addGuardWear`.

   No seed is involved, so a new opening can't break it.
2. **A seed list as the fallback** for any number that can't be forced cleanly: the case passes if any of a short list of seeds shows an effect, and it reports which seeds it tried.

The match-based digest stays as one end-to-end case (a single number over one seed list), so the check still proves that data reaches a real match.

**I1 tests:**
- pack round trip over every field's range, and rejection of out-of-range values;
- replay v3 record, play and JSON round trip;
- a changed bit is caught;
- a v2 file is refused.

## 6b. I1 as built (2026-10-01)

**The record.** `sim/input/intent.gd` holds the v2 fields next to `stance`, `dash` and `charge`.
- `SimIntent.VERSION` is 2.
- `pack()` gives one 40-bit integer: the 35 bits of §5, then today's stance (3 bits), dash and charge.
- `unpack()` returns null for anything that isn't a packed intent.
- `canon()` puts the stick on its 1/127 grid.
- Nothing reads the new fields. `SimTouch.build()` and the keyboard still write today's fields and are untouched.

**Hash.** `hash.gd`'s intent list is the 20 fields.

**Replay v3** (`sim/core/replay.gd`).
- Inputs are `[tick, slot, packed]`, and the header carries `intent`.
- The recorder steps the sim with each intent's canonical form, so what is recorded is what was played.
- `play()` refuses, with reason `format`, another format, version or intent schema, or an input that isn't a packed intent.

**The proof, as run.**
1. With the hash list and the golden generator untouched, parity passed against the untouched goldens: every vector, 9 matches (164,457 ticks) and the replays.
2. The new fields were then hashed, and the scripted replays extended to drive every v2 field from a second random stream. One regeneration followed.
3. Afterwards, the per-tick digests of all 9 matches and both replays are identical to the set before I1. The match is the one it was; only the hashed input fields changed.

**Parity checks:**
- "intent pack": the round trip over every field's range and 4,000 random records, canon, and 8 rejected integers;
- "replay module": record, play and JSON round trip, a changed input, a v2 file, two other intent versions, an invalid packed input, other data, and a setup replay.

**Also in the window:**
- `batch.gd` and `tempo.gd` cut a match off at 900 s of match time (`S.T`), not at 43,200 steps. Hit-stop steps don't count, and `MAX_STEPS` (120,000) is only a safety stop.
- The wired-number check runs a forced probe per number (`_wiredProbe`: a fresh match, the state that number needs, one call into its reader), with no seed to maintain. One end-to-end row still plays matches and passes on any of five seeds.

## 6c. I2a as built (2026-10-01): the core lines, behaviour-neutral

**The switch.** A slot is v2 when `f.act.v2` is true. The match setup sets it (`"v2": [bool, bool]`), or the slot's writer does (the AI, in I2b). It is an explicit flag, not "the intent carries v2 fields", for two reasons:
- a neutral v2 intent carries none;
- the scripted golden replays have driven every v2 field since I1.

For a slot that isn't v2, today's `stance` field works as before, so the keyboard and the touch bridge still play. The flag goes in I3.

**State** (`SimState.ActState`, `Fighter.act`, hashed): `v2`, `queue` (each request is [weight, mode, entry, tick]), `guardSince`, `dodgeTick`, `dodgeCool`, `burstCool`, `mode`, `assist`, `formReady`, `burstFired`. `Exchange` gains `tpl` and `branch`, hashed.

**What runs for a v2 slot** (`SimControl.control`, after the stun gate):
- `SimAct.update(S, f, i)`: the cooldowns count down; `guardSince` and `dodgeTick` follow the record (stamped with `S.tick`); a non-auto `mode` is kept; a `powerPress` clears `burstFired`.
- `f.stance = SimAct.stance(S, f, i)`:
  - Guard (`guard` held);
  - Escape (`sprint` with the stick beyond `awayDead`, away from the opponent);
  - Dodge (inside `dodgeWindow` ticks of a `dodge`);
  - otherwise Press. Neutral reads as Press for now.

**What the other two windows call:**

| Who | Call or field | For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Encounter (I2b) | `f.stance`, as today | the derived stance, snapshotted at exchange start |
| | `f.act.v2 = true` in the AI's writer (or the setup) | the AI on v2 |
| | `SimAct.wantsBurst(f, i, threatened)` | the burst: on the press when threatened, on the tap otherwise, never twice for one press |
| | `SimAct.push`, `upgrade`, `expire`, `peek`, `pop`, `clear` | the request queue (depth `SimAct.queueMax`) |
| | `f.act.dodgeCool`, `f.act.burstCool` | set on use; they count down in `update` |
| | `f.act.guardSince`, `f.act.dodgeTick`, `f.act.mode` | hold time, the dodge window, the piece family |
| | `ex.tpl`, `ex.branch` | set when the exchange is planned |
| | `ladder.json manualTierUp: true`, then `SimFighter.transform(S, f)` | the gate on: a threshold sets `f.act.formReady`, and the transform raises the tier one step with today's power-up. `transform` returns false when nothing is ready. The rising edge of `formReady` is in `stepFighter`; `transform_ready` can be emitted from the director when it sees the flag |
| | `SimAct.assisted(f, "autoBurst")` and the other assists | the Simple layout's assists |
| Controls (I2c) | the setup's `"v2"` and `"assists"` per slot | marking a layout's slot |
| | `SimIntent.canon(i)` before `SimCore.step` | live play on the 1/127 grid |
| | `SimAct.dodgeWindow`, `awayDead`, `queueMax` (static, defaults from `input-scheme.md`) | set from Controls' data at load |

**The stun gate** (`SimWounds.gateIntent`) now also ends the v2 held states and drops the v2 edges; broken legs clear `sprint`.

**The proof, as run.**
1. With the hash list untouched and the stun gate's v2 lines not yet in, parity passed against the untouched goldens, except the roster hash (`ladder.json` gained `manualTierUp`). That covered every vector, 9 matches (164,457 ticks) and the replays.
2. The new state was then hashed, and the goldens regenerated once.
3. The per-tick digests of all 9 matches and both replays are identical to the set before I2a.

**Parity checks added:**
- "action state": every rule above asserted, including the gate with its flag off and on.
- A v2 replay: two v2 slots, record, play and JSON round trip, with the derived stance taking at least three values.

## 6d. Intent version 4 as built (2026-10-05): the record past 53 bits

Controls added the stance mask (bits 47 to 50), `contextHeld` (51) and `sigHeld` (52) in `sim/input` (`docs/controls/lunge-control.md`): `BITS` 53, `VERSION` 4. That fills what a JSON number can hold exactly, so the core changed how a replay stores the record (the EP's ruling, option b):

- **The sim still packs one integer.** `SimIntent.pack` and `unpack` are unchanged in shape. A GDScript integer has 63 usable bits, so **10 bits are spare** and the next fields need no format change.
- **Only the replay's JSON splits it.** An input entry is `[tick, slot, low, high]`: the packed intent's low 32 bits and the bits above them (`SimReplay.split` and `join`); both null for no intent. Each part is far below 2^53, so it survives JSON. The replay format is v4; a v3 file, an entry of the old shape, half an entry, a fraction or a part out of range is refused.
- **The hash:** `stanceMask`, `contextHeld` and `sigHeld` are appended to `INTENT` in `hash.gd`.
- **Goldens:** one regeneration. Light digests and tick counts did not move (nothing reads the new fields yet); every full-state checkpoint and the tick-0 states moved, because the intent is in the state hash. The golden replays are scripted recipes, not stored replay records, so nothing in them was rewritten.
- **Checks:** the pack test covers masks 0 to 15 with both levels, the top bit, the first invalid integer at 1 << 53, and every case's two-number entry through JSON. The replay check refuses the bad entries above and plays back a recorded match that holds the new fields.
- **I3 stays its own slice** (the legacy `stance`, `dash` and `charge`). It is a behaviour migration for the AI and the old layouts, not a record edit, and it frees 5 more bits when it lands.
- **Open, for Controls and Encounter:** under a stun `SimWounds.gateIntent` ends the held states (`guard`, `sprint`, `power`, `lightHeld`, `heavyHeld`). It does not touch the stance mask or the two new levels. Nothing reads them yet; the rule is needed before the zip does.

## 7. Open points

1. **Controls:** confirm the two power edges (`powerPress`, `powerTap`) are enough for the burst rule, and the `sprint` threshold in the layout.
2. **Game Design and Combat:** the Neutral state's column.
3. **Encounter:** who raises the tier at a transform, and the `transform_ready` and `transform` event fields, for `fx-events.md` (I2).
