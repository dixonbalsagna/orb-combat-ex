# Fight mood, acts and player style as sim components (plan)

Status: plan, approved (Simulation, 2026-09-30). It is updated with Game Design's numbers and Narrative's thresholds. Sources:
- Game Design, `docs/design/spec-wounds.md` §9 (7e87793, b04fd8b): the acts, the mood's impulses, decay, bands and aggression, and the sign-off on the style thresholds;
- Narrative, `docs/narrative/dialogue-director.md` §1 and §8: the mood model and the player-style profile;
- Narrative, `docs/narrative/style-thresholds.md` and `style.draft.json` (92a1913): the label thresholds and stability rules.

Slice **M1** (Simulation, size M). It lands after D1a and reuses D1a's data loader and hash. The outputs are consumed afterwards: by Encounter's Q4 slice (aggression), and by World and Rendering (the crowd state).

## 1. What moves into the sim, and what stays out

| In the sim: `sim/core/mood.gd`, state in `S.mood` and `f.style` | Stays presentation (Narrative, Audio, Camera) |
| :--- | :--- |
| The mood value, its band and the act index | Line selection, the freshness engine, seen-memory, cross-match memory |
| The per-fighter style profile: a 60 s window, match-long totals, labels and shifts | The mood-graph nodes per fighter (`playful`, `grim`, ...) and the register families |
| The outputs `S.mood.aggression` and `S.mood.crowd` | `momentum`, `dominance`, `stakes`, `fatigue`, `rivalry_heat` (§1.1). The dialogue director derives these from events. They move into the sim only if a sim reader needs one |
| Events when the band, act, crowd or a label changes | The dialogue director's own seeded stream |

The rule from dialogue-director §8.1 holds: presentation reads the mood and never writes it, and the sim never reads which lines were chosen.

## 2. State layout

Everything is an integer. There are no floats in the component's state, so it is exact on every platform.

**The mood's unit is 1/60 of a point.** At 60 ticks a second, a rate of one point per second is exactly one unit per tick. So every number in spec §9 is a whole number of units, and the per-second rates apply every tick, smoothly and with no rounding:
- 1.5 points is 90 units, 2.5 is 150 and 0.5 is 30;
- −6 per second is −6 units a tick, −4 per second is −4 and +1 per second is +1;
- the range 0 to 100 is 0 to 6000, and the thresholds 30 and 70 are 1800 and 4200.

**Match: `S.mood` (class `MoodState`)**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `t` | int | non-frozen ticks the component has run (hit-stop ticks do not count) |
| `v` | int | the mood, 0 to 6000 (0 to 100 points) |
| `band` | int | 0 Calm, 1 Tense, 2 Frenzied |
| `cand`, `candT` | int | the band the value is in when it differs from `band`, and the ticks it has stayed there (the dwell) |
| `act` | int | 1 to 4, never lowered (a Rally does not undo an act) |
| `beats`, `forms` | int | act beats (region breaks, and each core's first battered: pitch A) and transformations so far, both fighters; `act = min(4, 1 + beats + forms)`. Until M1 lands this is `S.game.actBeats` |
| `aggression` | int | the output, in permille |
| `crowd` | int | the output: 0 `excited`, 1 `nervous`, 2 `fleeing` |
| `casGiven` | int | the casualty impulse given so far, in units (see §4) |
| `lastCombo` | int | the running exchange's chain count last tick (chain links, §4) |

**Per fighter: `f.style` (class `StyleState`)**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cur` | int[M] | the current second's counters (M measures, below) |
| `buckets` | int[60 × M] | the last 60 one-second buckets, a ring |
| `bi`, `filled` | int | the ring index, and how many seconds are filled (up to 60) |
| `win` | int[M] | the running window sums: add the new bucket and subtract the oldest, so there is no rescan |
| `total` | int[M] | match-long sums |
| `label` | int | the current label, or −1 for none |
| `leaveT` | int | seconds the current label's leave condition has held |
| `enterT` | int[6] | seconds each label's enter condition has held |
| `leftAt` | int[6] | when each label last ended, in component seconds (the refractory rule) |
| `shiftAt` | int | when the last style-shift event fired (the minimum gap) |
| `runKind`, `runLen`, `runMax` | int | repetition: the current run of the same attack kind, and the match's longest |

**Measures (M = 11 per bucket), from Narrative's §8.2:**
- `stance0` to `stance3`: ticks in AGGRESSIVE, DEFENSIVE, EVASIVE and ESCAPE;
- `light`, `heavy`, `sig`: attacks. **An attack is an exchange the fighter's director started, counted by its weight at the start, not a button press** (Game Design, b04fd8b). The source is the `attack` event (`actor` and `kind`), which the director emits when it accepts a request and starts the exchange;
- `closing`: ticks spent closing on the opponent (the shortest-arc distance fell by more than a dead zone);
- `opened`: units of distance opened;
- `charge`: ticks charging;
- `chargeCut`: charges interrupted.

Signature hits are not in the window. `sigLanded` goes into `total` only, as match-long `special_use` for Narrative; no label reads it.

Hiding is out of the base game (EP ruling), so there is no `hidden` measure and no `hider` label. The stealth fighter's profile adds both (`hide_habit`) when that fighter lands. The measure list is data, so adding them is a data change plus one counter.

The cost is about 680 ints per fighter, plus a dozen for the match, all hashed. The hash walk is linear, so this adds a few microseconds per checkpoint.

## 3. Update rate

- **Every tick** (non-frozen, at the end of `SimCore.step`, after `dirUpdate` and the beams), `SimMood.tick(S)` does the following:
  1. Adds this tick's impulses (§4) to `v`, then the rates: both AGGRESSIVE +1; the decay −6 toward the act floor; −4 more while both hold DEFENSIVE or ESCAPE. It then clamps to 0 to 6000.
  2. Updates the band candidate and the dwell (§4). Emits `mood_band` when the band changes.
  3. Adds to each fighter's `cur` counters. Counts `region_broken`, and `form_change` later, into `breaks` and `forms`. Emits `act_change` when the act rises.
  4. Recomputes `aggression` and `crowd` when the band or act changed. Emits `crowd_state` when the crowd changed.
- **Every 60 ticks** (`t % 60 == 0`): each fighter's bucket rotates (`win` and `filled`), and the labels are evaluated (§5). Emits `style_label` on a change.

**Inputs are events and state, not hooks.** The component reads this tick's `S.out.fx` and a few state values, so director and world code need no edits. The cost: the input events become gameplay-relevant. Removing or renaming one changes the goldens. `fx-events.md` will mark each one "mood input".

## 4. The mood's rules (Game Design, spec §9; the values in `data/fight/mood.json`)

| Impulse | Points | Units | Source in the sim |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| strike landed | 1.5 | 90 | a `damage` event with a number, kind `light` |
| heavy strike landed | 2.5 | 150 | `damage`, kind `heavy` |
| chain link | 3 | 180 | the running exchange's `combo` rose this tick (state; no event needed) |
| parry | 4 | 240 | `parry` |
| signature beam lands (HIT or GUARD, not a clash; Game Design) | 6 | 360 | `decisive` with kind `beam` (the director's signature hit or guard) |
| heavy or beam clash | 8 | 480 | `clash_draw`, or `decisive` with kind `clash` or `beam_clash` |
| region break | 12 | 720 | `region_broken` |
| launch through a building | 6, or 10 for a chain | 360 or 600 | a new core event, `building_hit` {actor, n}, from `SimFighter._buildingHits` (mine); `n` is the building's number within this flight, and 2 or more is a chain. World's brunt chain uses the same event when it lands |
| transformation cinematic | 10 | 600 | `form_change` (F1) |
| finisher start | 15 | 900 | `finisher_start` |
| taunt or banter line | 3 | 180 | a `taunt` event, when taunts exist. Barks are presentation, so only a taunt the sim performs counts |
| casualties | 0.5 each, normalised, at most 8 per event | 30 each, at most 480 | the world's casualty count (below) |

**Rates, every tick:**
- both fighters in AGGRESSIVE: +1;
- decay −6 toward the **act floor** (0, 600, 1200 and 1800 for acts 1 to 4). The decay stops at the floor. It never lifts a mood that is below the floor, since events do the lifting;
- while both fighters hold DEFENSIVE or ESCAPE (each in either): −4 more, also stopping at the floor.

The value is then clamped to 0 to 6000.

**Casualties, normalised with no drift.**
- Each tick, `target = floor(30 × 425 × S.world.casualties / pop0)`: the float64 product, floored once to an int.
- The impulse is `min(480, target − casGiven)`, and then `casGiven = target`.
- So a tick's casualties are one "event": the cap drops the excess of a big collapse instead of leaking it into later ticks, and fractional people carry over exactly through the cumulative count.

**Bands.** Calm is below 1800, Tense 1800 to 4200, Frenzied above 4200. The value must stay in another band for a **180-tick (3 s) dwell** before `band` changes. There is no further hysteresis. A return to the current band resets the dwell.

**Act.** `min(4, 1 + breaks + forms)`, never lowered.

**`aggression`** (permille, one match-wide scalar): `1000 + 100 × (act − 1) + {0, 250, 500}[band]`, capped at 1800. Each fighter's own difference comes from stance cadence (`stance-matrix.md` R9) and personality data, and multiplies with it. How Encounter spends it (cadence, blitz chance, the 0.6 s gap) is Encounter's Q4.

**`crowd`.** Calm is `excited` (they watch from a distance), Tense `nervous` (they retreat), Frenzied `fleeing`. World combines this global state with local danger (the fight's distance, B1 and B2's evacuation), so crowd behaviour stays World's rule.

## 5. The style labels (Narrative's thresholds, signed off by Game Design; `data/fight/style.json`)

The labels are evaluated at 1 Hz on the 60 s window `win`, using integer cross-multiplication. There is no division: "share above 55%" is `100 * part > 55 * whole`.
- `stanceTotal` is `stance0 + stance1 + stance2 + stance3`.
- The attack total is `light + heavy + sig`: exchanges started, by weight at the start.

| Label | Measure | Enter above | Hold to enter | Leave below | Hold to leave |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `turtle` | stance1 / stanceTotal | 55% | 45 s | 45% | 5 s |
| `rusher` | stance0 / stanceTotal | 60% | 20 s | 50% | 5 s |
| `runner` | (stance2 + stance3) / stanceTotal | 50% | 20 s | 40% | 5 s |
| `charger` | charge / stanceTotal | 20% | 15 s | 12% | 5 s |
| `sniper` | sig / attacks, with at least 4 attacks in the window | 35% | 20 s | 25% | 5 s |
| `mixer` | real variety (below) | | 30 s | see below | 5 s |

**Mixer** (style-thresholds.md §2). All three must hold:
1. no stance above 40%;
2. at least 3 stances used at 15% or more each;
3. at least 6 attacks in the window, with no attack kind above 70% of them.

It leaves when any other label enters, or when the largest stance share has been above 50% for 5 s.

**Stability rules:**
- `minWindowFillS` 30: no label is evaluated until the window holds 30 s (`filled >= 30`).
- `startUnlabelled`: a match starts with no label.
- `priority` (turtle, runner, rusher, charger, sniper, mixer): when more than one label is ready to enter, the first in this order wins.
- `shift.refractoryAfterLeaveS` 10: a label cannot re-enter within 10 s of ending (`leftAt`).
- `shift.minGapS` 20: a `style_label` event that changes one label into another (a style shift) fires at most once per 20 s per fighter (`shiftAt`). A label whose enter hold completes inside the gap waits, still ready, until the gap ends.

**The data shape**, which is Narrative's draft (`style.draft.json`) as the file:
- `schema` `fight.style/1`;
- `windowS` 60, `evalHz` 1, `minWindowFillS` 30;
- `priority`;
- `shift` {`minGapS`, `refractoryAfterLeaveS`, `startUnlabelled`};
- `labels` {name: {`enterPct`, `enterHoldS`, `leavePct`, `leaveHoldS`}}. The sniper adds `minAttacksInWindow`. The mixer adds `maxStancePct`, `minStancesUsed`, `stanceUsedPct`, `maxAttackKindPct`, `minAttacksInWindow` and `leaveMaxStancePct` 50.
- Each label's `measure` is a fixed key the code implements (`share(stance1)`, `share(stance2+stance3)`, ...), not a formula string.
- `qaBands` stays in the file for QA. The sim ignores it.

**The opponent's reaction** (a rusher meets evasion) needs no extra state. It is the pair of both fighters' labels, read by Encounter and Narrative.

**`data/fight/mood.json`** (schema `fight.mood/1`):
- `unitPerPoint` 60;
- `impulses` {name: units}, the table above;
- `casualty` {`perPerson` 30, `capPerEvent` 480, `popRef` 425};
- `rates` {`bothAggressive` 1, `decay` 6, `bothGuarded` 4};
- `actFloors` [0, 600, 1200, 1800];
- `bands` {`tense` 1800, `frenzied` 4200, `dwellTicks` 180};
- `aggression` {`base` 1000, `perAct` 100, `bandBonus` [0, 250, 500], `max` 1800};
- `crowd` ["excited", "nervous", "fleeing"].

Every value is an integer.

## 6. Events (into `S.out.fx`; rows go into `fx-events.md` with M1)

| Type | Fields | When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mood_band` | kind (`calm`, `tense`, `frenzied`), amount (the mood in points, `v / 60`), n (the act) | the band changed, after the dwell |
| `act_change` | n (1 to 4), kind (`break` or `form`, the cause) | the act rose |
| `style_label` | actor, kind (the new label, or "" when a label ends with nothing to replace it), text (the previous label, or "") | a label entered, ended or shifted |
| `crowd_state` | kind (`excited`, `nervous`, `fleeing`) | the crowd output changed |
| `building_hit` | actor, x, n | a launched fighter hit a building (a mood input; also useful to Audio and Camera) |

There is no per-second mood event. Readers that want the value read `S.mood` (a render reader reads state freely). The events are only for changes, so Audio's music layers and Camera's stances key on them, and QA gets time-in-band and the label bands from them.

## 7. Who reads what

| Reader | Reads | Where it runs | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Encounter (Q4) | `S.mood.aggression`, `band`, `act`, both fighters' `style.label` | sim (director) | Cadence, blitzes and the style reaction (a rusher meets evasion, a turtle meets guard breaks), within every tier cap |
| World | `S.mood.crowd` | sim (collateral, evacuation, runners) | Combined with local danger |
| Rendering | `S.mood.crowd`, `crowd_state` events | presentation | Crowd dressing and animation (cities.md: dressing is Rendering's) |
| Audio | `mood_band`, `act_change` | presentation | Music layers per act and band |
| Camera | `act_change`, `mood_band` | presentation | Camera stance per act |
| Narrative | all of `S.mood` and `f.style` (window, totals, runs), all the events | presentation | Line choice, thoughts, boasts and density. Never writes |
| QA | the events, and `S.mood` at the KO | tools | Frenzied ≤ 25% of match time; Calm ≥ 15%; blitzes 2 to 6 a minute in Tense and Frenzied (from Encounter's events); the label bands in `style.json` |
| UI | nothing | | Acts and mood are invisible (spec §9). There is a debug overlay only |

## 8. Determinism and the hash

- The state is all integers, so the mood cannot drift. The only float is the casualty product, floored once from values that are already sim state.
- The 1 Hz step is keyed to `S.mood.t`, not `S.T`, so hit-stop and the KO slow-down cannot shift it.
- `S.mood` and every `f.style` field go into the state hash in declaration order. The five events join `FX_FIELDS`.
- **M1's proof, in two parts.**
  1. With M1 observing only (no reader wired), fighter trajectories are unchanged. The goldens are regenerated once, because the hash gains fields and the new `building_hit` event. The check is a one-off run with the mood block and the new event left out of the hash, which must reproduce the pre-M1 goldens exactly.
  2. A forced vector (like `rallyHash`) drives scripted stances and events through band and dwell, act floors, the casualty cap, every label's enter, leave and refractory timing, the shift gap and the window-fill rule. It is hashed into the goldens.
- Encounter's and World's readers come after M1, each with its own golden change.

## 8b. M1 as built (2026-09-30)

**Files.**
- `sim/core/mood.gd` (`SimMood`) loads `data/fight/mood.json` and `style.json`. It checks every shape and folds both into the replay header's data hash; the goldens record them as `fightHash`.
- `SimState.MoodState` and `StyleState` are in `state.gd`, both hashed.
- `SimMood.tick` runs at the end of each non-frozen `SimCore.step`, after the water. `SimMood.reset` runs in `newMatch`.

**The act has one source.** `SimMood.act(S)` = min(act.max, 1 + `S.mood.beats` + `S.mood.forms`). `wounds.gd` reports its beats through `SimMood.beat` (a region break, a core's first battered), and `SimWounds.act` delegates to it. `S.game.actBeats` is gone.

**Inputs.**
- `damage` with a number, kind light or heavy, attacked by `attacker`.
- `parry`, `clash_draw`, `decisive` (clash, beam_clash or beam), `region_broken`, `building_hit`, `finisher_start` and `attack`.
- The running exchange's `combo`, for chain links.
- `S.world.casualties`.
- The fighters' stance, velocity and state.
- `building_hit` is new, from `SimFighter._buildingHits`; `Fighter.flightHits` resets whenever the fighter isn't launched.

**Measures.**
- *Closing and opening:* x velocity toward or away from the opponent beyond a 50 u/s dead zone (`CLOSE_DEAD`, a definition of the measure).
- *Opening* adds units of distance.
- *Charge cut:* an `attack` whose defender state was CHARGING.
- *Signatures landed:* counted in the match total only.

**Style rules as run.**
- The window fills to 30 s before any label is judged.
- A label ready to enter replaces the current one only if it comes earlier in the priority (any label replaces the mixer).
- A shift waits 20 s from the second the current label began, whether it entered or shifted in. Counting from the last shift alone let a label that had just entered be replaced a second later.
- A label that ends can't re-enter for 10 s.
- The mixer leaves when its largest stance share exceeds 50% for 5 s (`leaveMaxStancePct`, `leaveHoldS`).

**Proof.** With the mood block, the style state, `flightHits` and the five new events left out of the hash, parity passed against the untouched pre-M1 goldens. That covered tick-0, every vector, all 9 matches (176,405 ticks, every per-tick digest and checkpoint) and the replays. The goldens were then regenerated once, with a forced vector (`moodHash`) and `fightHash`.

## 8c. M1b as built (2026-09-30)

**Game Design's retune (data):**
- `rates.decay` 4;
- `impulses.heavyStrike` 210 (3.5 points);
- `actFloors` [0, 600, 1500, 2400] (0, 10, 25 and 40 points).

**Proportional decay (data, off).** `rates.proportional {on, base, perMille}`. When on, the decay is `base + floor((mood − floor) × perMille / 60000)` units a tick, which is 2 + 0.08 × the points above the floor, per second.

**Act beats (data).**
- `actBeats.every` is [regionBreak, form]; `actBeats.oncePerMatch` is [limbBattered, coreBruised, coreBattered], each the first time either fighter reaches it. Limbs are the arms and legs.
- `wounds.gd` reports every stage change through `SimMood.onStage`.
- `S.mood.onceMask` (hashed) holds the once-per-match beats already counted.
- `Fighter.coreMarked` and `S.mood.forms` are gone. A transformation (F1) calls `SimMood.beat(S, "form")`.
- `act_change.kind` is the beat's name.

**Style revision 2.**
- Narrative's `style.draft.json` goes in as written, plus the mixer's `leaveMaxStancePct` 58 and `leaveHoldS` 10.
- `minHeldS` (12) is a code rule: a label can't end, or be replaced, until it has been held that long. A shift already waits 20 s from the label's start.

**Landmarks:** `impulses.landmarkFall` 600 (+10) is read from a `building_fall` event whose `landmark` field is true. It stays dormant until World's D1 emits that field. A building falls only once, so the impulse comes once per landmark.

**Removed:** `SimFx.buildingHit`. World's `buildingHitB2` emits `building_hit` since B2.

**The act beats change behaviour.** Two gameplay rules read the act: the act-1 wear damping, and the crippling roll's late-act bonus. The new beats end act 1 earlier, at the first limb battered or the first core bruised, so they change matches.

**The proof, as run.**
1. With the old beat rule kept by a temporary switch, and the mood and style state and the mood events left out of the hash, the M1b code reproduced goldens made the same way from the pre-M1b code. That covered tick-0, the wound, Rally and crippling vectors, all 9 matches (171,959 ticks, every digest and checkpoint) and the replays. So everything except the act beats leaves the match unchanged.
2. The new beats were then switched on, and the goldens regenerated once.

## 8d. Q10: the act rule and the event list (2026-10-01)

- **The act rule** (Game Design, spec-wounds section 8b; `docs/architecture/q10-pace-acts-pauses.md`): with `actBeats.formSteps` true, `SimMood.act(S)` is `min(act.max, 1 + larger of (form steps, wound beats) + region breaks)`. Form steps are the most ladder steps any one fighter has taken (`tier - 1`), wound beats the once-per-match beats reached (the bits of `onceMask`), region breaks `S.mood.breaks`. `actBeats.every` is now [regionBreak]. With `formSteps` false the rule is M1b's (1 + every beat).
- **The mood reads only this tick's events.** `SimMood.tick` takes the tail of `S.out.fx` whose `tick` is `S.tick`. Before, it read the whole list, so the mood depended on the host draining the list every tick (a replay played back without draining read old events again). `SimReplay.play` now drains the list as well.

## 8e. The form impulse (2026-10-02)

A transformation's break adds `impulses.form` to the mood (900 units, 15 points; `rates.decay` is 3: QA's values). It is given by a call, `SimMood.onForm(S, f)` from `SimFighter.tierUp`, and not read from the `tier_up` event: on a full or short version the break lands on a frozen tick inside the pause, where `tick()` does not run. The parity check "the form impulse" holds it on such a tick.

## 8f. The mood by a blow's form (2026-10-05)

A blow feeds the mood by what kind of blow it was (Game Design, `docs/design/melee-press-feel.md` section 9d, ruling 2). The `damage` event carries the form in `mode`, and `SimMood.tick` picks the impulse from it. The rules, the new impulses, what was measured and the levers are in `brawl-wear-and-mood.md`.

## 8g. The retune on the riposte build (2026-10-05)

`impulses.brawlLight` 13, `rates.decay` 5, and `actBeats.oncePerMatch` is a limb battered and the core bruised: the core becoming battered no longer raises the act. The reasons and the readings are in `brawl-wear-and-mood.md` section 6.

## 8h. The double hit (2026-10-06)

The director's cue `double_hit` (an even trade ending with both blows landing) adds `impulses.clash`, to no one fighter, on the tick the cue is sent (`zip-core.md` section 4). A `knockback` event with no attacker adds nothing: the double hit throws both fighters back that way, and its mood is the 480 alone (it read 840 before, with 180 for each throw).

## 9. Open points

- **Taunts and transformations** have no sim events yet. Their impulses are in the data and dormant until `taunt` (Encounter or Narrative) and `form_change` (F1) exist.
- **World:** how `crowd` combines with local danger in evacuation.
- **Tools:** the schemas for `fight/mood.json` and `fight/style.json`, from §5's shapes, when the files land.
