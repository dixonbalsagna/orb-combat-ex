# ADR 0005: Lean team and token discipline

Status: accepted (EP, 2026-09-29; Orb asked for a reasonable distribution)

## Context
The project runs on a Claude Pro plan with zero budget. On the night of 2026-09-28, all 22 director sessions ran at once, alongside several multi-agent workflows, and used up a full 5-hour usage window in about 25 minutes. The EP's brief-drafting workflow alone used about 1.7 million subagent tokens. The EP session's growing context was also re-read on every notification. Orb asked for a distribution that can actually finish something playable.

## Decision
- **Few directors at a time.** Three to five directors work at once. Everyone else stays idle, which costs nothing. The EP briefs a director only when its work is on the critical path or unblocks it.
- **No standing ultracode.** Workflows run only when Orb approves a specific task: a bounded, high-stakes check of at most five agents. A workflow that was interrupted may be resumed from its journal to finish; it is not restarted.
- **Effort (Orb's choice).** Opus directors run at xhigh and Sonnet directors at high. The EP session should run at high.
- **Short messages.** Briefs and reports stay short, and deliverables go in files. The EP reads summaries rather than whole documents, and does not subscribe to idle notices.
- **Read only what the task needs.** Directors don't re-read the whole prototype unless the task needs it.
- **Keep the EP's context small.** When its context grows large, the EP session is refreshed from docs/ep/handoff.md and memory.

## Consequences
- Less happens in parallel. The critical path runs in bursts within each 5-hour window.
- Idle directors keep their context, so resuming them later is cheap.
- This ADR revises the effort and ultracode settings in ADR 0003.

## Amendment, 2026-10-23 (Orb)

For the end-of-week push on planet generation, biomes, fighter animation and camera work, Orb authorised workflows: "Workflows sounds good, why haven't we authorized this yet?" For those four areas, until the weekly window resets, directors may run workflows of up to about 10 agents for their briefed tasks. The machine rules still hold. Workflow agents author and analyse. Godot runs and browser captures stay inside the session's own caps: at most 6 Godot processes a session counting its workflows (3 while long runs are going), one software-rendered capture at a time, and long runs at below-normal priority. Ultracode stays off. Everything else in this ADR is unchanged.
