Owner: Art Director. 2026-09-29. Art owns `art/` and `docs/art/`.

|---|---|---|
| `style-guide.md` | The look: faceted cel, scale and readability, palette and value rules, masks, sigils and head flashes (Marked plus flashes, v1), outline, what Rendering needs, wear and damage on bodies, biome palettes | v1 draft |
| `anti-hero-concepts.md` | Round 1: three Anti-hero silhouettes (A, B, C), the silhouette test, a recommendation. Orb picked none | v0, pending Legal review |
| `anti-hero-round2.md` | Round 2: five silhouettes (D, E, F, G and C revised), forms without a pole, the test, a recommendation, three questions for Orb | v0, pending Legal review, Orb decides |
| `directions.md` | Four character art directions (Blank, Ink, Toy, Poster), each drawing all four fighters, with a comparison and a recommendation | v0, pending Legal review, Orb decides |
| `blank-variations.md` | Round 3: five variations of Blank (Seam, Porcelain, Marked, Inked, Aura) in three-quarter view, with expression answers and a greybox mock-up | v0, pending Legal review, Orb decides |
| `marked-aura.md` | Round 4: Marked plus head flashes: mask tone per fighter, the sigils, sixteen flashes with timing, priority and rules against the HUD crown, four staged moments in the greybox scene, and Legal's conditions applied (`ma-5-legal-checks.svg`) | v0, Legal's conditions applied, pending Legal's confirmation, Orb decides |
| `flash-prototype-spec.md` | The spec for a small in-engine head-flash prototype on the placeholder fighters (for Rendering) | v0 draft |
| `coil-turnaround.md` | The Anti-hero (the Coil) turnaround: front, three-quarter left and right, back, the crouch, forms, wear, a part list | v0, pending Legal review |
| `protagonist-turnaround.md`, `empress-turnaround.md`, `cyborg-turnaround.md` | The other three turnarounds in the Coil's format (front, three-quarter left and right, back, the pose in play, read sizes, wear, mask close-ups, a part list) | v0, pending Legal review |
| `district-looks.md` | The visual brief for World's districts: the shape list changes, a short brief per district look, and the five landmarks (cleared by Legal, RL-040). The chart is `district-shapes.svg` | v0 draft |
| `dynamic-sky.md` | The dynamic sky: five keys that extend the sunset, how they blend round the planet and drift with time, how mood and damage change them, the fastest allowed rate, and the contrast with the lane colours (data: `data/art/sky.json`; sheets in `art/concepts/sky/`) | v0 draft, pending Legal review |
| `colour-vision.md` | The colour-blind presets (protan, deutan, tritan) for the two fighters' lane colours, the simulated-vision check, the limits, and the rule for future fighters (data: `data/art/colour-vision.json`; sheet in `art/concepts/colour-vision/`) | v0 draft, pending Legal review |
| `launch-pair-look.md` | The launch pair's look (the Protagonist and the rival): approved by Orb on 2026-10-04, and where the reference sheets are | Approved by Orb |
| `../../art/concepts/refine/README.md` | Index of the refinement sheets (the Cyborg's six directions; the other three's unmasked faces and silhouette options) and the question each asks Orb | v0 draft, pending Legal review, Orb picks |
| `closeup-directions.md` | Orb's request for memorable, recognisable face close-ups: three directions (the mask as a face, the mask partly broken, no mask), six rounds of criticism and revision, the damage stages on the face, and a recommendation | v0 draft, pending Legal review, Orb picks |
| `rule-of-cool-art.md` | The art side of Orb's rule-of-cool picks: the face cut-in portraits, battle damage in three stages, the Anti-hero's aura colours for his three forms, and the stacking-rule check | v0 draft, pending Legal review, Orb picks the aura colour |
| `cosmetics-plan.md` | The plan for a vast unlockable cosmetic set by data: categories, what keeps each fighter readable, counts per fighter, and what the fighter mesh needs from day one | v0 draft |
| `ai-prompt-policy.md` | How AI-assisted art is made, recorded and reviewed | v0 draft, for Legal and Orb to review |
| `../../art/concepts/anti-hero/` | The SVG sheets and the deterministic generator that writes them | v0 |

**Superseded.** The wave-1 art brief (three whole-game directions, `docs/art-bible/`) is replaced by Orb's answers: 2.5D side-on, cel-shaded plus low-poly. Nothing under `docs/art-bible/` was written. The parts that still fit are in the style guide: biome look notes and destruction states (section 8), the silhouette test (3.1) and the palette rules (3).

**Decisions still owed by Orb** (ranked in `anti-hero-concepts.md`, section 9)
1. The Anti-hero's silhouette (round 2 recommends D, the Duelist, with a coiled low posture; see `anti-hero-round2.md` for the three questions).
2. Shed Regalia: deferred by Orb.
3. The Anti-hero's face, age and build.
4. Cape: decided, none. Narrative's Empress line will change once his look is picked.
5. How graphic the wounds are on screen by default, and whether civilians visibly die.
6. The number of forms (six now).
7. The hue lanes for the four fighters.
8. Whether AI-assisted concept art may appear in devlogs and the store page, and who is the human author of the final fighter designs (`ai-prompt-policy.md`).

**Folder note.** `art/concepts/.gdignore` keeps Godot from importing concept art into the game project. It also keeps concept SVGs out of exports.
