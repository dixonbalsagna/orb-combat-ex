# The timing-edge test plan (QA, 2026-10-02)

Owner: QA and Balance. Orb: "lets run balance tests on your recommendation, consistent timing should give the fighter a substantial edge." The rules are Game Design's (`docs/design/agency-pass.md`, section 2 and "What QA measures"); they are not built yet, so this plan is ready to run and today's run is the baseline: the sim has no timing rules, so every timed player should read about 50% against its untimed twin.

## What is in the harness

| Piece | Where | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scripted players | `qa/godot/players.gd` | A masher, a holder, a tapper with adjustable timing accuracy, a fixed mix, and the AI at a level, played against each other through the real input path (a v2 human slot, forms taken). Each keeps the press log the sim will keep, reads it with Controls' classifier (`sim/input/press_read.gd`, thresholds from `data/input/timing.json` `read`: hold 12 ticks, rhythm 2 of the last 3 within 4 ticks, mash 4 presses with gaps of 10 or less) and reports what it reads |
| Matchup runner | `qa/timing-edge.js` | The matchups below, 3 Godot processes at a time (6 Windows processes), win rates with Wilson intervals against Game Design's bands, damage per exchange, launches earned, turn-taking |
| Exchange endings | `qa/godot/records.gd`, `bands.js` | Standing rows `10.end.launch`, `10.end.knockback`, `10.end.continue` in every run (section "Brawl endings") |

**The players.** Spec strings: `masher[:gap=8]` (a press every `gap` live ticks; a press that falls in hit-stop is held for the next live tick), `holder[:hold=16][:rest=24]` (press and hold a heavy, then rest), `holder:timed=1:acc=A:win=6` (a hold released within `win` ticks of a blow's contact, `A` percent of the time), `tapper:acc=A:win=4:mix=LLH` (presses its own blows: `A` percent of presses land within `win` ticks of the blow's contact, the rest miss it by 3 to 10 ticks more; `jit` adds jitter; it requests an exchange every `idle` ticks between exchanges), `mix:mix=LLH:gap=12`, `ai:level=easy|medium|hard`. Add `:forms=1` to take every ready form (the pure masher without forms fights at tier 1 and cannot win, `docs/director/masher-probes.md`). The tapper reads the blows' contact ticks from the running exchange's scheduled strikes (read-only), so it can press on, before or after them by an exact amount; Game Design's thresholds are `win`: taps 4, a steady mash 3, a hold's release 6.

**Styles and the players that stand for them** (agency pass section 2): blur = a mash, power = a hold, combo = taps.

| Style | Untimed | Timed (80% of beats) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Blur | `masher` | `tapper:win=2:jit=0:acc=80:mix=L` (a steady mash within the blur's 2 ticks of the director's contact) |
| Power | `holder` | `holder:timed=1:acc=80:win=6` (released within 6 ticks of the flash) |
| Combo | `tapper:acc=0:mix=LLH` (the style-only player: a sensible mix, never on the beat) | `tapper:acc=80:win=4:jit=0:mix=LLH` (taps within 4 ticks of the director's contact for a blow) |

The classifier can hold a player to the style it meant: the harness prints how many presses read as rhythm, hold, mash or taps, and the share on the beat, so a script that is not doing what it claims shows up.

## The matchups

Everything else equal: same fighters (slot and spawn alternate by seed so they cancel), same forms policy, same AI level where an AI is present. Win share is of decided matches; intervals are Wilson 95%.

**Core (Game Design's three bands first):**

| ID | A against B | Band for A's win share |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| T1 | timed (80% of beats) against a masher | **72 to 82%** (agency pass) |
| T2 | timed against a style-only player | **62 to 70%** (agency pass) |
| T3 | style-only against a masher | **55 to 62%** (agency pass) |
| T4 | both timed (a mirror) | 45 to 55%: timing is the skill, so equal timing is a fair fight |
| T5 | both style-only (a mirror) | 45 to 55% |
| T6 | timed mash against a plain mash | 62 to 82% (the same upgrade, per style) |
| T7 | timed hold against a plain hold | 62 to 82% |
| T8 | timed against the medium AI | 60 to 80% (a skilled player beats the medium AI; the masher stays 35 to 50%) |
| T9 | masher against the medium AI | 35 to 50% (`control-rules.md` section 6; already a standing row) |

**Accuracy sweep (the shape of the edge):** a tapper at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% accuracy against a masher and against a style-only player. Expected: the win share rises with accuracy, passes 50% somewhere around the accuracy where an off-beat press stops mattering, does not exceed about 90% even at 100% (so timing is an edge, not a lock), and the steps are smooth (no cliff at one threshold).

**Run size.** 100 matches per matchup for a verdict, 40 for a baseline; the 95% half-width is about 10 points at 100 and 15 at 40, so a result inside 3 points of a band edge needs 300.

## The measures

1. **Win rate** (the bands above).
2. **Damage per exchange** for each side (damage dealt over exchanges started as the attacker). Proposed: the timed player deals at least 25% more per exchange than its untimed twin (the combo upgrade alone is +15% per timed strike; blur and power add more).
3. **Launches earned** per match for each side (`launch` events caused). Proposed: the timed player earns at least 1.5 times the launches of its twin, because flow 3 or more is what lets a heavy ender launch.
4. **How exchanges end:** launches, knock-backs and continues as a share of melee exchanges, for each side's exchanges and for the pairing. Proposed for two timed players: brawl-continue at least 50% (the trade of stomach punches Orb pointed at), and turn-taking (the attacker changes from one exchange to the next) at least 45%.
5. **Flow**: how many timed presses in a row (the harness reads the press log; the flow count itself is sim state and needs an event once it exists, `flow` per fighter).
6. **Style read**: for each player the classifier's read of its presses (a masher should read mash, a timed tapper rhythm, a holder hold). A script that reads wrong is a script bug, not an edge.

## Proposed bands for "a substantial edge" (for Game Design to confirm)

Game Design's three bands stand; QA adds the following, each with its reason.

| Band | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| Timed against an equal untimed twin, same style: **62 to 82%** | A substantial edge is a 60-plus; above about 85% timing is a lock and the untimed player has no game |
| No player above **90%** at any accuracy against any of the scripted players | Timing must stay beatable by a good style choice |
| Timed against timed: **45 to 55%** | The edge belongs to the timing, not the slot or the spawn |
| Win share rises with accuracy, 40% accuracy at least 55% against a masher | A half-good player is already ahead of a masher |
| Timed player's damage per exchange at least **1.25 times** the twin's; launches earned at least **1.5 times** | The edge is in damage and in endings, not only in luck |
| A timed player beats the medium AI **60 to 80%**; the masher stays 35 to 50% | Skill beats the AI, mashing only competes |
| Signatures deal at most **30%** of a match's damage (agency pass, provisional) | Beams must not decide every match: measured from the existing damage events by kind (a beam hit is kind `beam`); the standing row comes with the signature retune |
| Blow for Blow (when built): reached by two timed power players in at least 30% of their exchanges and by none of two masher; ends by a missed beat | The named set piece must come from timing |

## Brawl endings (standing rows)

Agency pass section 3: a melee exchange ends with the brawl continuing (both in reach) 40 to 50%, a knock-back 20 to 30%, a launch 25 to 35%. `records.gd` now classes every melee exchange (light or heavy) by its ending: a launch event inside it is a launch; the sim has no knock-back or continue state yet, so everything else is counted as "other" until `exchange_end {actor, kind: continue | knockback | launch}` events exist (it reads them as soon as they do). Rows: `10.end.launch` (25 to 35%, live: it fails today at about half the exchanges), `10.end.knockback` and `10.end.continue` (pending until the events), and an INFO row for the share that is not a launch. The old row "exchanges that end in a launch (40 to 65%)" is retired to INFO.

## What needs to exist before the edge can be measured

| Needed | From | Used for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The alchemist: the press log per fighter in sim state, the three timing upgrades, the flow count, the earned-launch rule, knock-backs | Encounter, Simulation, Combat (slice 4) | the edge itself |
| `exchange_end {actor, kind}`, a `flow` field or event per fighter, a `flash` event at the blow's wind-up (the hold's release target) | Encounter | the endings rows, the flow measure, the timed hold (today the hold script targets the blow's contact tick) |
| `lightHeld` and `heavyHeld` in the intent | Simulation (I3) | the holder (the scripts set them when the fields exist) |
| The final thresholds | Controls, Game Design | the scripts read the beat window from `timing.json`; steady-mash 3 and hold 6 are script parameters (`win`) until they are data |

## The baseline today

The first run of the core matchups on today's sim (HEAD `43f5f21`, no timing rules) is in `timing-edge-baseline.md`, with the same command the agency-pass sim will be measured with:

```
node qa/timing-edge.js --matches=100 --plan=all --md=docs/qa/timing-edge-results.md
```

Machine rule: 3 jobs, headless only (`--headless --script`).


## Scripts press against the director's own beat (2026-10-04, slice 13)

Encounter traced the timed masher to 56% on the director's beat at acc=80 (74% at acc=100). Cause: the script planned each press from `ex.beats` once, as `lt + round((b.t - ex.t) * 60)`, which is up to a tick off the director's count (`DirAlchemy._blows`: the exchange clock gains a tick, then every beat at or before it runs) and does not follow hit-stop; and a link's blow was not pressed at all. The tapper now recomputes the steps to each of its own pending blows every call, the same way, and presses when the steps left equal one less its offset. It also follows chain links and a blur string's blows, and presses the finisher's struggle: the fighter on the brink presses on each of the struggle's beats (`data/combat/finishers.json` contest.struggle `beatTicks`, from the contest beat's `sOpen`), within the half-width with the script's accuracy (`struggle=0` turns it off).
The harness now reads each press's beat from the director's own log (`DirAlchemy` `BEAT0`) instead of its own list: `directorOnBeat4` (within `beatHalf`, 4 ticks: the combo's timed press), `directorOnBeat2` (within `blurBeatHalf`, 2 ticks: the perfect blur) and `directorPresses` (presses made inside an exchange), plus `struggles`, `struggleHits` and `struggleStrays`.
Measured on the slice 13 build, against the medium AI, 20 matches (40 against a masher for the last two lines):

| Script | Presses read | Within 4 ticks | Within 2 ticks | Struggle hits, per struggle |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `tapper:acc=100:win=0:jit=0:mix=L` (the contact script) | 3,190 | 100% | 100% | 3.0 of 3 (39 hits, 0 strays in 13) |
| `tapper:acc=100:win=2:jit=0:mix=L` | 2,650 | 100% | 100% | 3.0 (78 hits, 0 strays in 26) |
| `tapper:acc=100:win=4:mix=L` (jitter 1) | 2,739 | 92.4% | 57.5% | 2.6 |
| `tapper:acc=80:win=2:jit=0:mix=L` (the timed mash) | 3,967 | 84.8% | 84.8% | 2.4 (34 hits, 8 strays in 14) |
| `tapper:acc=80:win=4:jit=0:mix=LLH` (the timed combo) | 2,769 | 86.7% | 52.2% | 2.3 |

So at acc=80 the script is on the director's beat 85 to 87% of the time (the 80% plus off-beat presses that fall near another blow); the contact script is exactly 100%. The earlier 56% and 74% were the planning error, not the sim. The jitter option adds a tick either side of the window; the timed scripts now use jit=0 so that "within 4" means within 4.
