# VFX: as built

Owner: VFX Director. Code: `render/vfx/`. Plan and reasons: `docs/vfx/plan.md`. Budgets: `docs/vfx/effect-budgets.md`. Written 2026-09-29.

Presentation only. VFX reads the sim's state and fx events and draws; it never writes the sim, never touches `S.rng`, and takes its randomness from streams derived from the match seed (`vfx.trail`, `vfx.shard`, `vfx.dust`, `vfx.hole`, `vfx.crack`). `render/vfx/tools/hash_check.gd` proves the gameplay hash is unchanged (below).

## What is in the game now

| Effect | State | Where |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Motion trails: a tapered ribbon behind a fast fighter, and world-fixed wind marks the camera flies past | **Live** (trails are on by default) | `trail_state.gd`, `trail_view.gd`, `shaders/trail.gdshader` |
| Ground cracks and fissures from `S.craters` and `S.slides` | Built, **off** (`VfxLook.CRACKS_DEFAULT`) | `crack_gen.gd`, `crack_mesh.gd`, `crack_view.gd`, `shaders/crack.gdshader` |

| Scorch embers by beam variant | Built, **off** (`VfxLook.EMBERS_DEFAULT`) until Rendering stops drawing ImpactFx's own scorch sparks | `debris.gd` (`embers`) |
| Break ring: one thin arc at the front the moment a fighter reaches full speed | **Live** | `trail_state.gd`, `trail_view.gd` |

Rendering's hooks (committed in ef2d55c): `SimHost.vfx` (a `VfxHub`: `reset`, `consume`), `PaneWorld.vfx_layer` (a `VfxLayer`: `hub`, `build`, `update`), and in `main.gd` `note_frame`, `reduced_motion`, `--novfx` and `--vfx-quality=0|1|2`. The layer finds its pane's curvature state and the planet's ground field through its parent, so nothing more is needed.

To turn the "off" groups on for a look: set `host.vfx.cracks_enabled`, `destruction_enabled` and `embers_enabled` (the tools do), or change the defaults in `vfx_look.gd`. Colours are read from `data/art/effects.json` (`palette.gd`, warmed at match start; the placeholders in `vfx_look.gd` only stand in if the file is missing): glass, steel and dust by biome, the crack line and lit lip by biome (the ocean takes no cracks), the trail core.

## The effects

**Trails.** Speed is the fighter's displacement per unfrozen tick in body heights a second (bh/s, 75 units). Nothing below 40 bh/s, full at 110 (Orb decides; the EP kept these defaults). Melee dash tops out at about 18, a traversal dash is 60 to 180, a median launch about 144. The ribbon has two layers (accent band, near-white core) in four hard steps, at z -12 (behind the fighter, never over it), at most 14 bh long. Wind marks are lens-shaped dashes fixed in the world, spawned 4 to 18 bh ahead of the fighter and left behind; each is at least three frames long so it never strobes. A fighter's marks draw only while it is on screen. A rush gets no trail unless it is faster than 110 bh/s (it has its own silhouettes). Reduced motion removes the marks and halves the ribbon; quality low drops the outer band and the marks.

**Cracks.** A crack set is a pure function of one sim record (a crater or a slide), the match seed and the quality level, so a seek or late join rebuilds it identically (`hub._sync_cracks` reads `S.craters` and `S.slides`, not events). Hairlines run mostly along x (they read best at the grazing camera), forks and jogs, more and longer with sqrt(energy); a hard blow (E 6 or more, or `special`) adds one to three wide fissures with broken edges and a lit lip; a slide adds splits along both trench edges, a herringbone of spurs and a fan where it stopped. Lines are cut every 40 units and draped on the ground as drawn (`GroundField.ground_at`); the shader widens each to a least on-screen thickness (the ground is seen at about 6 degrees), lifts it 6 units, grows the web outward over 0.45 s of sim time, and stops at the fighter plane (the foreground rule pulls land in front down). A plan idea, a cutaway gash at the ground profile, was dropped: land in front of the plane occludes anything at the plane below the profile, so it cannot be drawn without drawing over fighters.

**Shrapnel, holes, dust.** `building_hit` (B2: `b x y z damage ratio outcome link n spd keep ux uy kind w h owner victim`) gives the burst-through: glass slivers and triangles and a dust puff thrown back at the entry on the front face, a forward cone of glass, steel bars and concrete chunks at the exit, a thin ring at each. A collapse leaves no holes (the building goes); heavy, wreck and crack leave a jagged hole decal, up to three per building, removed when it falls. `chain_link` streams dust and chips along the segment. `building_fall` (exists) schedules, at its `delay`, a dust skirt around the base, a column up the tower and chips falling straight down, plus a flat ring; a folded summary (`b` -1) is one cloud. Debris flies ballistically (gravity 1,000, two bounces off the terrain), in front of the facade (z = facade + 24 to 54) and behind the fighters. Sim hit-stop slows it to a tenth, as for the reference particles.

## Pictures

## Tools

All from the repo root, with Godot 4.7.2. Tools with pictures need a window; `--headless` ones do not. A new `class_name` script needs one `godot --headless --path . --import` before a tool can see it.

| Tool | Command (after `--script res://render/vfx/tools/`) | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `hash_check.gd` | `-- --seeds=12345,4,7 --ticks=3600 [--negative-control]` | Gameplay hash (which includes `S.rng`) against the sim alone, every 60 ticks, for 60 Hz, 144 Hz, two jittered runs, quality low with reduced motion, and the split screen, with cracks and destruction on. Fails if the effects never ran. The negative control must fail |
| `vfx_shots.gd` | `-- --out=DIR --seed=4 --split [--cracks] [--on=impact --delay=25]` | Pictures from a real match at full trail strength, or after each impact |
| `crack_shots.gd` | `-- --out=DIR [--only=impact_mid,slide_paved]` | Posed cracks on staged craters and slides |
| `mock_shots.gd` | `-- --out=DIR --scenario=burst\|heavy\|chain\|implode\|all` | The mock burst-through, a heavy wreck with a hole, a three-tower chain, a block imploding, with Camera's 21-tick hold |
| `worst_case.gd` | `-- --frames=360` | The worst scene (a chain through four towers, an imploding block, 14 crack sets, two fighters at full trail), on and off |

## Checks run (2026-09-29, Godot 4.7.2, RTX 5070 Ti, Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 1280x720)

- **Hash.** `hash_check.gd` passed on seeds 12345, 4 and 7 to tick 3600, all six ways, cracks and destruction on. In those matches the sim's own `building_fall` events drove 6,797 debris bits, 1,095 marks spawned and 122,780 ribbon segments were drawn, and 54 crack meshes were built in 30.4 ms. The negative control (a 0.001 nudge of one fighter's x) fails. Rendering's `determinism.gd` passes with the hooks in.
- **Trails on a real match** (seed 4, 4,800 frames, split on): frame mean 1.688 ms without VFX, 1.702 with; p99 3.619 and 3.646; draw calls 189.6 and 189.8; the same final gameplay hash.
- **Worst-case scene** (`worst_case.gd`, VFX on against off): frame CPU mean 0.369 against 0.226 ms, p99 0.906 against 0.342, max 0.932 against 0.406; GPU mean 0.113 against 0.112; draw calls 25 against 24 (max 31 against 26). The hub's `consume` averages 0.22 ms with a 2.9 ms peak on the tick that spawns a chain and a block at once, and the layer's `update` 0.17 ms with a 1.8 ms peak. The debris pool reaches its 460 cap, 14 crack sets are 3,718 triangles, 16 ribbon segments and 10 marks.
- **Not measured:** the web build and an old laptop. The desktop CPU cost is small; on a machine several times slower the peak tick would be a dropped frame, which is why spawns are budgeted per tick (`SPAWN_PER_TICK`) and crack meshes build one a frame. The web number needs the CI export and `research/engine-spike/tools/bench-browser.mjs` with and without `--novfx`.

## Known limits

- Building depth. Rendering still draws every building's face at `RenderLook.Z_BUILDING_FRONT`; `VfxHub.front_z()` is the one place to change when it draws them at the sim's own `z`.
- The sim's own `debris` and `dust` events for a building's fall are still drawn by Rendering's particle view, so a collapse shows both while destruction is on. One of the two should go before it ships (Rendering and VFX, through the EP).
- The fighter is not hidden inside a building during the burst-through: that needs B2's depth (`z`) and Rendering's fighter placement. The prototype shows the fighter in front of the facade.
- Colours are placeholders (`vfx_look.gd`); Art's semantic roles replace them as data.
- Trails and beams share a colour language (accent and near white). If a playtest reads them as one thing, the trail moves to a neutral pale.

## Added after the first report

- **Fissure vents.** A fresh fissure (a record under half a second old) throws two dust puffs up from every third point as its front reaches it; a set rebuilt after a seek has none.
- **Scorch embers.** `scorch` events shed embers by variant: glass flecks (GLASS TRENCH), cinders (FIRESTORM), spray puffs (HORIZON CLEAVE), heat-ramp sparks elsewhere. Fire keeps the orange and yellow. Rendering's `ImpactFx` still draws its own sparks for the same event, so this stays off until it stops.
- **Break ring.** One thin arc, 0.25 s, at the front of a fighter the moment it reaches 110 bh/s from below (not in a rush, not twice within 1.5 s).
- **Implode column.** Dust in three tones (dark back bank, body, light front) in the biome's colour, and the column is spawned floor by floor over half a second, top first.
- `tools/effects_check.gd` (headless) asserts the palette, vents, embers, the pool cap and the ring; it passes, and `hash_check.gd` still passes on seeds 12345, 4 and 7 with all three groups on (9,122 debris bits from the sim's own `building_fall`).

## Playtest 2 fixes (2026-09-30)

- **Arcs and wires over the terrain.** Cause: the crack shader widened each strip in world z at a fixed height, so on a mountain flank the edges hung in the air, and cracks reaching past the ground band (where the drawn ground is the far relief, not the sim's) floated above it. Fixed: widening is now in screen space from vertices that stay on the ground; cracks stop at 80% of the band's depth; and they fade out between 2,500 and 7,000 units behind the plane.
- **Embers.** They fire only on `scorch` events, that is, a beam close to the ground, and only with `embers_enabled` (Ctrl+F6). They were 10 to 26 units long with 1 to 4 per event, so invisible next to ImpactFx's sparks. Now 30 to 80 units long, 2 to 8 per event, up to 12 a tick and 100 alive, in the heat ramp (glass flecks over a glass trench, spray over the sea). `mock_shots.gd --scenario=embers` shows all four variants.

## B2 events, live (2026-09-30)

The sim now emits `building_hit` (with `floor`-less summaries for small buildings), `floor_hit`, `floors_fall`, `chain_link` and `launch_depth` (`docs/architecture/fx-events.md`). The hub reads them as they are:

- `building_hit` on a small building (under 5 floors): the whole-building burst at the hit point (`x`, `y`, unit velocity `ux`, `uy`; the real speed is `spd` times the launch's traversal factor), plus a hole decal if it stands. On a skyscraper the same tick's `floor_hit` draws the burst and the summary adds nothing.
- `floor_hit` punch: the burst confined to the floors struck, a row of windows blowing out along the facade, rings; crack: a window shower; dent: a puff and chips. **No decal**: Rendering cuts the tunnel into the mesh from `fmask` (EP ruling). `floors_fall`: dust and glass and steel at each broken floor, top first over 0.4 s, then a ring at the base.
- `chain_link`: dust and chips along the segment. Shards and dust sit at the building's real facade depth (`z + d / 2`), now that Rendering draws buildings at the sim's own depth.
- One tick's spawns are budgeted (260 puffs, then 200 shards) so a busy tick stays small.
- Pictures from real matches (`tools/brunt_shots.gd`, seed 1): a four-house chain ![chain](img/b2-chain-real.png) and a punch on a 23-floor tower, far back in the depth rows ![floor punch](img/b2-floor-punch-real.png)
- Checks: `effects_check.gd` covers punch, crack, dent, pancake, the summary being skipped when a `floor_hit` came, holes only for small buildings and the pool cap under repeated pancakes; `hash_check.gd` (seeds 12345, 4, 7, all groups on, real B2 events: 15,941 debris bits) and `render/tools/determinism.gd` pass; worst-case scene CPU +0.17 ms mean, +0.55 ms p99, GPU +0.008 ms.

## Trail kink fix (2026-09-30)

Bug: a trail bent behind a fighter flying straight. Cause: the ribbon's head was drawn at the fighter's chest (feet + 36) but the history behind it was stored at the feet, so the first segment dropped 36 units and then ran level, a kink at the head on every flight. The hybrid projection, camera motion, pane anchors and the seam were not involved (the ribbon is built in world space and a planar line stays a line under the perspective). Fix: the history is stored at chest height (`trail_state.gd`). `effects_check.gd` now asserts a level and a climbing flight give a ribbon on one line (it measured 36.000 units off before the fix and 0.000 after). Before and after, same seed and tick: ![before](img/trail-kink-before.png) ![after](img/trail-kink-after.png)

## Trail at depth (B3, 2026-10-01)

A launched fighter now flies into the building rows at the sim's depth (`Fighter.z`, interpolated by `host.fighter_z`). The trail keeps `z` in its history, draws the ribbon head at the fighter's depth (12 units behind it) and each segment at the depth it came from, scales its least on-screen width by the perspective at that depth (the pane camera's distance is passed by the layer), and places marks and the break ring relative to the fighter's depth, so the tip meets the fighter and the ribbon sorts with it. `effects_check.gd` asserts the ribbon's depth run (head at the fighter's z, tail at the earlier depths). Picture (mock burst, the fighter eased into a tower's row): ![trail at depth](img/trail-at-depth.png)

## More dramatic splashes (2026-10-01)

Orb on the skipping: "looks great, and i'd like to see more dramatic splash effects." Skip, plunge, beam strike and a low fast flight's wake now throw cel-drawn spray streaks and foam scaled by the fighter's speed and tier (code `water.gd`, numbers `data/vfx/water.json`, flag `water_enabled`, default on). Full write-up with before and after pictures, budgets and the plan for the coming `left_ground`, `bounce`, `skip` and `land` events: [water-plan.md](water-plan.md). A plunge 10 ticks in, before and after: ![before](img/water-plunge_t10-before.png) ![after](img/water-plunge_t10-after.png)

- Checks: `effects_check.gd` has 16 water cases (scale, a skip and a fifth skip, a splash of 8 not double-handled, plunge and rebound, low quality, beam, the cap, wake, off, data fallback, data against defaults); `hash_check.gd` (seeds 12345, 4, 7, six ways) and `determinism.gd` pass with water on; `worst_case.gd --sea` is the cost scene.

## Transformation effects (2026-10-01)

Keyed to the sim's `transform` event and its `version` (full, short, live), beat lengths from `moveset-rules.md` §10.8: the aura and loose dust are drawn inward on the gather, one ring leaves the body on the break while the aura swaps to the new tier's shape in a single frame, then the new aura holds steady and eases out. No upward flame, no lightning, the flash in the fighter's own colour. The clock is the host's tick, so a full or short version plays through the sim's pause (`S.pause.left`). Code `transform.gd`, `transform_view.gd`, `shaders/transform.gdshader`; numbers `data/vfx/transform.json`; flag `transform_enabled`, default on. Write-up with before and after pictures, budgets and what it needs from others: [transform-plan.md](transform-plan.md). The break, before and after: ![before](img/transform-full-break-before.png) ![after](img/transform-full-break-after.png)

- Checks: `effects_check.gd` has 16 transformation cases (beats per version and scaled to a longer reveal, the clock through frozen ticks, a live version holding on a hit-stop, aura timing, four distinct tier shapes, flag off, data fallback and data against defaults). `hash_check.gd` now readies a form at ticks 300 and 1500 in every run, so real `transform` events and their Q10 pauses are in the compared match (it fails if none started; 108 started across its runs); it passes with the effects on, and so does `determinism.gd`.

## Standing aura while charging or attacking (2026-10-01)

Orb's answer: the aura is on only while the fighter charges or attacks, not constant, not gone. The current tier's aura shape and colour, eased in over 8 ticks and out over 24 after an 18-tick hold, weaker than the transformation's own (0.40 alpha against 0.60), keyed to the charge hold, the beam charge, being the attacker of the running exchange, a rush, or an own beam. Code `aura.gd`, numbers `data/vfx/aura.json`, flag `standing_aura_enabled`. Write-up: [aura-plan.md](aura-plan.md). Before and after, 30 ticks into a charge: ![before](img/aura-charge-before.png) ![after](img/aura-charge-after.png)

- Checks: `effects_check.gd` has 14 standing-aura cases (off when free, eased in and out, the hold, each attack signal, defender excluded, hidden, frozen ticks, a transformation cutting it, a real AI minute where it comes and goes, data fallback and agreement); `hash_check.gd` and `determinism.gd` pass with it on.

## Reactions to power, speed lines and Legal's notes (2026-10-01)

Wave 0 of the rule-of-cool plan: from tier 3 rubble lifts off the ground (scattered, with weight) and cracks spread where a high-tier fighter stands still, and a big impact blows the windows out of the block along it; the aura flickers when the fighter is worn (the core's wear stage and the brink); and speed lines alone run toward the hit on every launch and landed heavy (impact treatment B). The world effects stand down while the fighter charges and during his transformation (Legal's stacking rule), and the aura, the transformation's ring and its flash are never gold, white or red (a red-orange lane colour is swapped for Art's Anti-hero violet; see the recommendation for `fighter.json` in the plan). Code `react.gd`, `speed.gd`; numbers `data/vfx/react.json`; flags `react_enabled`, `flicker_enabled`, `speedlines_enabled`. Write-up, Legal notes, what Rendering can read, budgets and pictures: [react-plan.md](react-plan.md). The windows, before and after: ![before](img/react-windows-before.png) ![after](img/react-windows-after.png)

- Checks: `effects_check.gd` has the reaction cases (flicker by wear stage and brink, rubble by tier, scattered and capped, standing down while charging, standing cracks starting, fading and being removed, windows by tier and energy with the shock's travel, the list for Rendering, Legal's colour rule) and the speed-line cases (a heavy, a launch, the dedupe and the gap, a real minute's count). `hash_check.gd` now sets tier 3 for one fighter at tick 900 and a battered core for the other at tick 1200 in every run (and readies forms at 300 and 1500), so the reactions run in the compared match; it fails if none did. `determinism.gd` passes.

## The "violet rectangle" on the live web build (2026-10-01): Rendering's guard glow, not the aura

The EP saw a flat translucent rectangle beside and behind a fighter's lower body on the live page and suspected the aura, the flicker or a shader failing under the Compatibility renderer. Checked with a real web export (Godot 4.7.2 Web template, Chrome with ANGLE on D3D11, 800x600, `VfxLook` defaults as committed):

- **No shader fault.** The browser console shows no shader or script error, and the aura draws as its shaped outline on the web (`img/web-aura-vorr-attack.jpg`: the curved violet arc round VORR while he attacks).
- **The rectangle is `FighterView.guard`.** A defensive stance (the guard glow, `render/core/fighter_view.gd`: a sphere scaled to 12 x 84 x 60 in the stance colour) is drawn as a thin tall translucent ellipse beside the body, a fighter's height tall. It is there with every one of my effects switched off: a web export with the transformation, standing aura, flicker, reactions and speed lines all defaulted off (`img/web-guard-glow-vfx-off.jpg`, KAI guarding) is identical to the build with them on (`img/web-guard-glow-vfx-on.jpg`), and the desktop build with them off shows the same on VORR (`img/desktop-guard-glow-vfx-off.png`). The standing aura is on only while charging or attacking, so a fighter in a guarding stance does not have it.
- What to change is Rendering's: the guard glow's mesh, or its look (it reads as a flat panel, a rectangle with a soft edge, not a shield). Not edited here.
- Reproduce: `godot --headless --path . --export-release "Web" build/web/index.html`, serve it, press N, hold Shift (guard) for KAI in the demo; or `render/vfx/tools/react_shots.gd --case=rubble --slot=1 --stance=1 --nofx`.

## The "pale blue block" on KAI (2026-10-01): Rendering's afterimages, not an aura layer

Second sighting on the live build: KAI attacking at tier 1 with a thin oval outline round him (the standing aura, correct) and a flat pale blue block from the hips to the feet. Reproduced on desktop with the real sim (seed 1, both AI, `probe` of every frame where the standing aura is up at tier 1 on the ground, 800x600): at tick 133 (the "2 HIT CHAIN" frame) the block is there, and at tick 81 a row of fading pale blocks trails KAI's dash. **The same frames with every VFX flag of this work off** (transformation, standing aura, flicker, reactions, speed lines, water; same seed, same ticks) **show the same blocks pixel for pixel**: `img/afterimage-vfx-on-t133.png` against `img/afterimage-vfx-off-t133.png`, and `img/afterimage-vfx-on-t81.png` against `img/afterimage-vfx-off-t81.png`. They are the sim's `after` fx events (afterimages of a dash or rush: `x, y, face, life, col`) drawn by `render/core/particle_view.gd` as flat rectangles in the fighter's aura colour (`SHAPE["after"] = 0`), which is also why they are KAI's #8fd6ff and why they hide his legs. Not VFX, so nothing changed here. The standing aura is only the thin oval in both pictures. Not repeated on a web export: the web build runs the same scripts and the same particle code, and last time's web pair (guard glow, effects on and off) matched the desktop one.

## Earth, material and fire (2026-10-01)

The reference consumer's placeholders taken over: `debris` squares become chunks that tumble, in the right material (the biome's earth, paving, steel and concrete, wood, foliage); `fire` discs become cel flames (a leaning tongue in three bands, a side lick, a wobble, a wisp of smoke); `dust` and a crater's and a slide's squares become scalloped puffs and tumbling ejecta; and World's ground-contact events (`land`, `bounce`, `left_ground`, `tumble_end`, `journey_end`, and the skid itself) throw clods, spray and dust by surface and speed. Code `earth.gd`, numbers `data/vfx/earth.json`, flag `earth_enabled`. Write-up with the exact hooks Rendering needs (one on `sim_host.gd`, one flag on `impact_fx.gd`), before and after pictures on desktop and web, and budgets: [earth-plan.md](earth-plan.md). A slam, before and after: ![before](img/earth-slam-before.png) ![after](img/earth-slam-after.png)

- Checks: `effects_check.gd` has the earth cases (material by colour, tumbling, the reference-event filter, flames within their cap with smoke only when not reduced, a slam by surface and speed, a skid, water ignored, a bounce, leaving a lip or a crest, settling, a wall, crater ejecta, a slide's end, the skid spray, a flood within the pool, and a real minute of launches with ground contact on). `hash_check.gd` and `determinism.gd` pass with ground contact on (the committed data): 12,472 chunks, flames and contact effects in the compared matches.

## Trails across contacts: no more arc beside a slam (2026-10-01)

Rendering traced a thick pale arc standing beside a slam to the launched fighter's trail ribbon (`trail-arc.png`). Cause: the ribbon is a polyline through the last 16 ticks of the fighter's path, so after a hard landing it was still the whole dive, drawn at up to 37 units wide in a pale band, and it faded at the flight's slow pace (0.25 s) even though the fighter had stopped, so it hung beside the impact while he skidded, hopped or lay still. With ground contact on a journey has several contacts, so this happens at every bounce. What a trail does now:

- **It breaks at each contact.** The sim's `land`, `bounce` and `journey_end` for a fighter cut his path to its last point (`VfxTrailState.cut`), so after a bounce, a landing or a stop the ribbon starts at the contact and tapers to the fighter. `left_ground` does not cut: the flight after it is the new trail.
- **It fades fast on the ground.** Within 50 units of the ground, sliding, down, or landed at below full-trail speed, its intensity and speed memory decay with 0.07 s instead of 0.25 s (`K_GROUND_TAU`): a trail is for flight.
- **It reads as a trail, not a shape.** The outer band's head width is 0.34 bh (was 0.50) and its alpha 0.36 (was 0.55); the thin core is as before.
- Pictures (real sim, a launch that bounces at about 5000 u/s, ground contact on, 1280x720): the same frames on exported HEAD without this change and with it: ![before, 4 ticks after the contact](img/trail-contact-before-t4.png) ![after](img/trail-contact-after-t4.png), and just after it ![before](img/trail-contact-before-t1.png) ![after](img/trail-contact-after-t1.png). Before, a long straight pale band rises from the contact point; after, a short stub that tapers into the fighter.
- I could not land on Rendering's exact frame (seed 1, tick 219): locally the intro phase shifts the ticks, so that frame is a different moment here. The mechanism is the one above and is reproduced with `render/vfx/tools/earth_shots.gd --case=trail` (a launch that bounces; `trailskid` is a flatter one).
- Checks (`effects_check.gd`, "trails across contacts"): the outer band is thin and pale; a contact keeps one point of the path; the ribbon after a landing is a taper of 140 units against the dive's 1500 and every point of it is within 200 units of the head; a trail on the ground has faded (k 0.19 from 0.99) after eight ticks where one in the air has not (0.62); land, bounce and journey_end each cut only the landing fighter's trail, and `left_ground` does not. `hash_check.gd` and `determinism.gd` pass.

## Speed lines: one streak an exchange (2026-10-02)

Game Design's rule (rule-of-cool.md row 11, balance-targets §22): one streak per exchange, on its launch if it has one, otherwise on its last landed heavy, and none on a hit that gets a panel. Done in `VfxSpeed` from the events already read plus `S.dirS.ex` (its `n`, `kind` and `tag`; no exchange id on the events was needed): a landed heavy waits for the end of its exchange (45 ticks at most) so that a launch can take its place; a signature exchange, a riposte that launches, a clash that is won (`decisive` clash, beam or beam_clash), and a hit with a `limb_break`, `ko` or `finisher_start` get none. The old per-victim 24-tick dedupe is off (the exchange is the cap now); the 6-tick gap and four alive stay. In eight AI-against-AI seeds over their first two minutes: 8.9 streaks a minute from 10.4 exchanges a minute that had a heavy or a launch (19 hits left to panels, 63 were an exchange's second hit); the 17 a minute in §22 is the full-length figure. `effects_check.gd` has the cases (last heavy, launch replaces heavy, signature, riposte with and without a launch, clash won and not, limb_break, ko, finisher_start, the 45-tick limit); `hash_check.gd` and `determinism.gd` pass.

## The intro: entrance craters, the effects clock, the landing's dust and the last stand's mark (2026-10-02)

**Why effects_check failed, and what the player sees.** `SimCore.newMatch` now starts every default match from the intro's end state: two entrance craters (energy 1.5, no owner, radius about 196 units) are in `S.craters` at tick 0, so the hub builds a crack set for each, and the "cracks and vents" checks (which dug one crater and expected one set) saw three. The checks now count one set a record. **At tick 0 the player sees two shallow bowls with fine dark cracks at the fighters' feet, drawn grown** (`img/intro-skip-tick0.png`): I decided they should draw, because they are real craters in the sim's record and a scar stays; they have no vents, because 1.5 is under the fissure energy. Before this change they would have spread over the first half second of the clock, so the cracks now start grown for a match that skips the intro.

**The effects clock.** The intro's ticks are pre-clock: `S.T` stands still while effects run at full speed (the `tick` mark says `frozen: false`). Anything keyed to `S.T` stood still with it: the landing's jobs, the cracks' growth, the blow-out list. They now run on `VfxHub.fx_now(S)`: `S.T` plus the intro's played ticks times the tick length (a constant after the intro, so craters and rebuilds agree). A played intro digs its crater at the landing and the crack set spreads then; a landing's dust jobs run.

**What I give the seven new events.**

| Event | Effect | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `intro_start` | none (Camera, UI); I only note that the intro is played, so a landing with no fall before it (the skipped intro) throws nothing | built (the flag) |
| `entrance_fall` | none here: the falling fighter's own trail, which the intro's ticks already feed, is the effect. A speed streak into the landing is possible but he is not launched, so I leave it | none, on purpose |
| `entrance_land` | clods thrown both ways, a low two-layer skirt of dust, a short dust column and one ring on the ground, scaled by the height he fell from, with the crater's cracks spreading from the landing | built (`earth.gd on_entrance_land`; before and after `img/intro-landing-*.png`) |
| `staredown_start` | none: stillness is the effect, and the landing's dust settles on its own | none |
| `clock_start` | none (UI, Camera, Audio) | none |
| `last_stand_ready` (actor, dur) | a thin steady ring at the chest in his lane colour (breathing a little; steady in reduced motion) while the free signature is his, counting his free time, easing in over 10 ticks | built (`aura.gd`, `transform_view.gd`; `img/laststand-*.png`) |
| `last_stand_end` (actor, kind) | `used`: one ring leaves him, expanding, over 12 ticks; `expired`: the ring fades over 30 | built |

The mark follows Legal's aura rule (a thin ring in the fighter's lane colour: no flame, no flash, no gold, white or red; the colour goes through `VfxAura.lane_color`) and is one quad (two for the leaving ring) in the transformation's draw call. It is on while `standing_aura_enabled` is.

Checks: `effects_check.gd` has the intro cases (two entrance craters and a set each, drawn grown with no vents, the effects clock, the landing's dust and none without a fall, reduced motion, a crater of a played intro born at its landing, a job running while `S.T` stands still, the mark's ease, hold on frozen ticks, fade, leaving ring, out-of-range actor, the flag); `hash_check.gd` and `determinism.gd` pass.

## The intro reel's three VFX faults (2026-10-02)

From Rendering's end-to-end intro reel (`docs/rendering/tumble-intro-render.md` 2.3a). Pictures are the real pipeline at seed 4 with the intro played: HEAD before, this change after.

1. **The landings' dust hung through the staredown.** The entrance dust lived 1.6 to 3 s, drifted up and the crater's own ejecta dust added 1.2 to 2.4 s on top. Now the landing's skirt and column live 0.8 to 1.4 s, hug the ground (rising at most about 200 u/s), and the ejecta of the landing's tick is as short (a 0.55 factor, `earth.entrance_now`). Every puff and chunk has cleared within 78 ticks of the landing, so B's dust is gone about 40 ticks into the staredown and A's long before it. `img/intro-staredown-before.png` and `-after.png` (tick 190).
2. **"Dark dashes on the sand beside the craters" were the entrance craters' crack sets, not chunks.** The chunks had gone by tick 260; the fine cracks draped on the ground read as dark dashes at the side-on camera. The two entrance craters (no owner, dug at clock zero) now get no crack set: the bowl and its rim already mark them. I also made an earth chunk that has come to rest fade within 0.3 s, so no settled chunk can lie on the ground as a dash either. `img/intro-dashes-before.png` and `-after.png` (tick 260).
3. **The landing ring and the pale arc.** The ring was an upright disc growing to about 1000 units across the sky. It is now a ground ring: a flat band (0.22 as tall as wide) at the crater, from 0.7 of its radius to about twice its radius in half a second, drawn as a band so it reads flattened; none in reduced motion. `img/intro-ring-before.png` (tick 52) and `img/intro-ring-after.png` (tick 40, camera on the landing). The pale arc under the falling fighter was the trail's **break ring** (a thin arc at the front of a fighter who reaches full speed, meant for flight): a scripted entrance fall is not that, so it has none while the fighter's state is `intro`; his own trail stays (the white line above him in the ring picture).

Checks (`effects_check.gd`, "intro and last stand"): the landing's dust lives under 1.5 s and rises at most 260 u/s, the ring is flat and ends within 2.5 crater radii, everything of the landing clears within 100 ticks, no crack set for an entrance crater (default or played intro), an earth chunk at rest has at most 0.3 s left, no break ring in the intro's fall; `hash_check.gd` and `determinism.gd` pass. Not run on the web build (`/play/?intro=1`): it is the same scripts and shaders, but the frames above are desktop.

## Power language and the levitating rocks prototype (2026-10-02)

Orb's note: fighters feel almost too fast at maximum transformation, so show tier some other way. `docs/vfx/power-language.md` pitches 18 ways (top five marked: blast amplification, levitating rocks, hover pressure, pressure rings on movement, light on the terrain), each with its start tier, Compatibility cost and Legal stacking fit. The rocks are built as a prototype behind `VfxHub.rocks_enabled` (default off, `VfxLook.ROCKS_DEFAULT`): `render/vfx/rocks.gd`, `rocks_view.gd`, numbers in `data/vfx/power.json` (needs a Tools schema). Tier 3 shows 5 loose chunks, tier 4 shows 10 and bigger, uneven and slow, standing down while charging, transforming, hidden, high or fast. Pictures `img/rocks-tier*.jpg`. `effects_check.gd` (`_rocks`) and `hash_check.gd` cover it. Needs Legal's re-screen before the flag goes on.

### Update (2026-10-02, later): Legal cleared the rocks; blast amplification and pressure rings

Legal cleared the rocks under five conditions (RL-057): the flag is **on by default** now, `effects_check.gd` asserts what can be tested (few, small, uneven, each drifting its own way, never a ring, never spiralling, never rising), and a frame strip for the motion re-check is in `img/rocks-drift-*.jpg`. Two more ideas from `power-language.md` are built, both on by default: **blast amplification** (`blast.gd`: a crater is bigger to look at by the causer's tier, `blast_enabled`; power-up craters stay as they were behind `blast_powerup_enabled`, default off, because they come with the charge's crouch and scream) and **pressure rings** (`pressure.gd`: a ring of shoved air at a dash, a hard stop or a hard turn, bigger by tier, `pressure_enabled`; the ring state is made and tested, **the drawing is not in yet**, see power-language.md). Numbers in `data/vfx/power.json`. Pictures `img/blast-tier*.jpg`.

### Update (2026-10-02, later still): power-up craters get the blast at the break (RL-059)

`blast_powerup_enabled` is on by default: a ground-level power-up crater gets the tier-scaled blast at the transformation's break only, one a transformation, never in the gather or in the air, never for a fighter on `VfxBlast.POWERUP_OFF` (empty). The rocks now sink in 0.15 s when his transformation starts (`FORM_OUT_S` in `rocks.gd`) so they are gone by the break. Cases in `effects_check.gd` `_blast()`; picture `img/blast-powerup-tier4-*.jpg`. The pressure rings' drawing still waits for Orb's answer on the refused edit.

### Update (2026-10-02, last): two streaks an exchange

Speed lines: a launch and a later heavy in the same exchange each keep their streak (the heavy that launched does not make a second): 10.9 a minute over 8 seeds, from 7.8 (docs/vfx/react-plan.md).

### Energy blasts drawn (2026-10-03)

Encounter's blasts fire real shots and nothing drew them; `docs/vfx/shots-plan.md`: every shot in `S.shots` each frame in its owner's colour (a bolt small with a short tail, a charged shot bigger by its power and charge with a halo, a seeking shot on a slight arc), the charge on the hand (the Anti-hero's plates, the others' thin rings), and the hits by outcome (hit, guard, deflect, shrug, stop), the trade's burst and a miss's dust. Flag `shots_enabled`, on; one draw call; a child of the trail view, so `vfx_layer.gd` is untouched.

### Blast explosions and mines of concept (2026-10-03)

`docs/vfx/shots-plan.md`, last section: a shot's hit and end are explosions (flame, sparks, smoke, thrown chunks, a flat ring, a smouldering scorch) sized by Game Design's blast radii, a knocked-loose shot tumbles and trails smoke, and the mines are drawn as a look only (hexagonal plates and caltrops, never a sphere). Flag `explosions_enabled`, on. New: `render/vfx/explode.gd`; a hexagon shape in `transform.gdshader`.

### GB-007: the levitating rocks no longer ride along (2026-10-03)

"Still" is now a walking pace (6 fighter heights a second, not 40) and every piece is let go in world space (falls and fades) the moment he speeds up or leaves the state, so none rides beside a fast mover or stays locked to him. docs/vfx/power-language.md, last section; `effects_check.gd` `_rocks_world()`.

### Round two of the blasts on screen (2026-10-03)

The sim's own mines (an entry of `S.shots` with mode MINE) are drawn by their look; `mine_trip`, `shot_deflect` (a mark where a wild shot will land) and the shot ends `mine`, `building` and `life` have their bursts; the spray's muzzle rings are rationed. docs/vfx/shots-plan.md, last section; needs from Simulation listed there.

### The beam plays on screen (2026-10-03)

The 20-tick crossing of a beam and the five plays (swat, split, walk-through, wade, late answer) each have their own look, driven by the slice 8 cues. `render/vfx/beamplay.gd`, drawn in the shots view; flag `beamplay_enabled`. docs/vfx/shots-plan.md, last section; `effects_check.gd` `_beamplay()`.

### The rival's glasses glare (2026-10-04)

Frame C (the bare wedge); the glare hides his eyes completely, in his pale violet, held 0.4 s at most. Today it rides his taunt and a signature's wind-up (a glint); the Chin plant, a Pride threshold and the seal break (cracked lens) are accepted once Simulation sends cues for them. `render/vfx/glare.gd`, drawn in the shots view; flag `glare_enabled`. docs/vfx/glare.md (cues needed, rules kept, the head estimate); `effects_check.gd` `_glare()`.

The wild deflect no longer marks its landing on the ground (Orb: the landing is a surprise). docs/vfx/shots-plan.md, the wild deflect row.

### The melee press styles (2026-10-04)

Each press style has its own after-image and contact look (Orb's reference docs/ep/prototypes/melee-trade-v2.html): speed is a soft overlapping blur and a small ring, tech three wireframe echoes, a line and a hard diamond, heavy a shrinking charge ring then ghosts, a filled crescent and a double ring (and a flying target's ghosts), block a shield line and a flash. First build behind `press_enabled`, driven by the `damage` event, the attacker's press log (read only), `tell_heavy` and `knockback`. `render/vfx/press.gd`; docs/vfx/press-styles.md (cost, what Animation and the director need, reduced motion); `effects_check.gd` `_press()`.
