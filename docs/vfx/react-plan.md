# VFX reactions to power

Owner: VFX Director. 2026-10-01. Wave 0 of the rule-of-cool plan (`docs/design/rule-of-cool.md` rows 1, 11 and 12), shaped by Legal's screen (`docs/legal/rule-of-cool-screen.md`) and by Orb's picks (impact treatment B, the stacking rule). Presentation only: it reads sim state and events and writes nothing, no `S.rng`, the gameplay hash is unchanged. Code: `render/vfx/react.gd` (class `VfxReact`, `hub.react`), `render/vfx/speed.gd` (class `VfxSpeed`, `hub.speed`), drawn by `transform_view.gd` and `crack_view.gd`, rubble and glass in the shared debris pool. Numbers: `data/vfx/react.json` (every key also has a default in `react.gd`; `effects_check.gd` asserts they agree). Flags on the hub, all default on: `react_enabled` (rubble, standing cracks, windows), `flicker_enabled`, `speedlines_enabled`.

## What each effect does

| Effect | Trigger (sim state already available) | Tier | Look | Reduced version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aura flicker** (row 1) | The core's wear stage (`f.stage[1]`: battered 0.5, broken 1.0) plus the brink (+0.25). Reads wounds, so it stays and builds through a transformation | Any | The aura's alpha drops out for a few ticks at a time (up to 80% at full wear), more often the more worn, with a 3% size stutter. A pure function of the tick: no random stream, the two fighters out of step | A steady dimming (up to 40%) instead of flicker |
| **Rubble lifts** (row 12) | A fighter at tier 3 or 4 near the ground (within 3 fighter heights), not charging, not hidden, not in his transformation, on dry land | 3 and up; wider and more at tier 4 (4 and 9 pieces a second, within 1.6 and 2.6 fighter heights) | Chunks of the biome's earth leave the ground one at a time and rise slowly with weight (a gentle upward acceleration, heavy slow spin), gone in 2 to 3 seconds. Scattered either side, never straight under him, never a ring | Quality scales the count (0.7, 0.35), reduced motion halves it |
| **Cracks spread where he stands** (row 12) | The same fighter standing still (under 300 u/s) on the ground for half a second | 3 and up | A web of cracks from his feet, drawn by the existing crack system, spreading over 2.5 s, kept while he stands there, faded out and removed 1.5 s after he leaves. Not a sim scar: the sim's own craters are untouched | Drawn at once and 60% smaller (no spreading motion) |
| **Windows blow out** (row 12) | A `crater` event (a big impact: energy 8 or more) caused by a tier 3 or 4 fighter | 3 and up; reach 1800 units at tier 3, 3200 at tier 4 | The nearest buildings of three floors or more (up to 10) throw glass off a few of their floors' rows, each after the shock has reached it (2600 u/s): a block's worth of windows going in a wave | Fewer buildings and glass (quality, reduced motion) |
| **Speed lines alone** (row 11, treatment B) | One streak an exchange (Game Design, 2026-10-02): on its `launch` if it has one, otherwise on its last landed heavy (`damage` of kind heavy with a number), and none on a hit that gets a panel: a signature exchange, a riposte that launches, a clash that is won (`decisive` clash), a finisher, a crippling blow (`limb_break`), the KO. The exchange is read from `S.dirS.ex` (index `n`, `kind`, `tag`); a heavy waits for its exchange to end (45 ticks at most) so a launch can take its place | Any | Seven thin lines at 0.7 alpha running toward the hit for 6 ticks and stopping short of it, behind the fighters. No cut | Four lines, no dark keyline |

Rationing: one streak an exchange (above), at least 6 ticks apart, at most 4 alive. Over the first two minutes of eight AI-against-AI seeds it came to 8.9 streaks a minute, with 10.4 exchanges a minute that had a heavy or a launch; the 17 a minute in balance-targets §22 is the full-length rate (12.3 heavies and about 13 launches a minute at the higher tiers). Panel cut-ins are Camera's and UI's, not here.

## Legal's constraints, and how each is kept

- **Stacking rule** (no more than two of the seven power-up marks in one moment). The world effects (rubble and the standing cracks) **stand down while the fighter charges** (`state == "charging"` or a beam charge) and during his transformation, so the scene "crouch, scream, body aura, rising rubble and cracks" cannot happen. The effects checks assert it. Aura only during charge and attack, as built.
- **Rubble lifts gently and with weight, not a ring.** Scattered (never spawned within a fifth of a fighter height of him, `min_dx` asserted in the check), small counts, slow.
- **No lightning, no wind, no darkening sky.** None is drawn. **The sky pales or parts is not built**: the sky belongs to Rendering's planet and sky shader; a pale-sky lift for tier 3 is a suggestion for them (see below).
- **Aura colour.** No gold, white or red. `VfxAura.lane_color` swaps a fire-range or near-white aura colour for Art's Anti-hero accent (`data/art/flashes.json` accents.A.mid, `#9a80d8`). The transformation's ring, flash and motes use it too, and I took out the white lightening I had put on them (the tier "mix" values are 0 now). **Fighter data is not changed.** The Anti-hero's `aura` in `data/fighters/VORR/fighter.json` is `#ff5a3c`, red-orange; **my recommendation is `#9a80d8` (Art's Anti-hero accent mid; its light step is `#c2adf0`)**, which makes the swap unnecessary. KAI's `#8fd6ff` is cool and used as it is.
- **Aura shape.** Thin outline and a faint fill (the fills are now 0.14 to 0.17 for the transformation and half that for the standing aura): oval, shoulder lobes, a low round crest, hip flares. Every tip is round, nothing is pointed or streams upward, and the tallest is 1.9 fighter heights. If Legal wants the crest and hip flares gone, tiers 3 and 4 become `lobes 1` and `lobes 1` in `transform.json` (one number each).
- **Transformation flash** stays in his own colour (the lane colour above); the break's ring and ground crack are as built.

## For Rendering

- **Windows going out on the facades.** I draw the flying glass only. The building shader's windows (Rendering's `fdmg` and `fmask` states) have no way to know a blow-out happened. `host.vfx.react.blowouts` is the list for them: each entry is `{b: building index, at: the sim time its windows go (S.T), strength: 0 to 1, lo, hi: the floor range}`, pruned six seconds after `at`. A shader can darken or break the windows of building `b`, floors `lo` to `hi`, from `at` on, with `strength` as the share. The hub fills it from the same `crater` events, so the picture and the facade can match.
- **The sky.** Row 12's "sky pales or parts from tier 3" is Rendering's; Legal's rule is that it pales or parts and never darkens. Nothing from VFX touches the sky.
- The crater cracks and the standing cracks share the crack shader: new `fade` uniform, default 1, and a material per slot for the standing sets (two more materials tracked with the pane's curvature).

## Budgets

- Draw calls: the aura, the speed lines and the transformation share one MultiMesh draw (now up to 220 quads), the standing cracks add up to two crack draws, the rubble and the glass are in the debris pool (no draw call). Everything at once (below): +3 draw calls.
- Rubble alive: 36 at quality high (inside the pool's 460), thinned with quality. Windows: at most 10 buildings and 6 floors each a wave, with the pool's per-tick spawn budget. Standing cracks: one set per fighter, mesh built like any other crack set.
- **Everything at once** (`react_shots.gd --case=bench`: both fighters tier 4 and worn, standing and charging in turn in the city, a big crater every second, a heavy every 8 ticks), 1280x720, fast desktop: frame CPU mean **1.02 ms against 0.40 ms** with the reactions off (p99 1.59 against 0.61), draw calls 27.7 against 24.6, peak bits 426 of 460, consume 0.41 ms mean (1.23 max). Not measured: the web build and an old laptop (Tools bench).

## Before and after

Real sim fighters, plains and city scenes, the sim standing still for the shot.

| Rubble and cracks, tier 3, 200 ticks into a stand | ![](img/react-rubble-before.png) | ![](img/react-rubble-tier3.png) |
| Windows, a tier 4 impact, 40 ticks in | ![](img/react-windows-before.png) | ![](img/react-windows-after.png) |
| Speed lines on a landed heavy, 3 ticks in | ![](img/react-speed-before.png) | ![](img/react-speed-after.png) |

## Speed lines after the wind-up rule (2026-10-02)

Encounter's slice 2 (f09c88b) changed the fight's rhythm, so the old check "a real minute makes 8 to 24 streaks" is gone: `effects_check.gd` now runs a controlled case (ten scripted exchanges: four heavies, three launches, one of two heavies, a signature and a riposte that launches give 8 streaks, 3 hits left to panels, 3 heavies behind a launch) and only asserts that real play fires at least once. Measured over 8 seeds of AI play, 2 minutes each, on HEAD ca4c276: **7.8 streaks a minute** (5.0 to 9.5 a seed) from 24.6 exchanges a minute, with 6.2 launches and 11.2 landed heavies a minute; 0.5 a minute were left to panels and 3.6 a minute were a second hit in an exchange that already had its streak. About one exchange in three gets a streak, one every 7.7 seconds, against the 17 a minute (one every 3.5 s) the one-per-exchange rule was sized on. My reading: still enough for the lines to read as an accent on the biggest hit of an exchange, too few to be a rhythm. If Game Design wants about 12 a minute, letting a heavy that follows a launch in the same exchange keep its own streak adds the 3.6 a minute that are capped now (about 11.4 in all); that is one condition in `speed.gd` and I would not change it without their number.

### Two streaks an exchange (2026-10-02, the EP's ruling: Orb asked for flashier combo trading)

`speed.gd`: an exchange now has a streak on its launch **and** on its last landed heavy, as long as that heavy is not the blow that launched (a heavy within 8 ticks of the launch is the same blow and gets none, so one hit is still one streak). The panel exclusions are unchanged (a signature, a finisher, a crippling blow, the KO, a won clash, a riposte that launches). Re-measured over the same 8 seeds, 2 minutes each: **10.9 streaks a minute** (6.5 to 13.5 a seed), up from 7.8, from the same 24.6 exchanges a minute; 0.5 a minute left to panels, 0.3 a minute a second launch capped. The controlled case in `effects_check.gd` now has twelve exchanges, including two with a launch and a follow-up heavy (12 streaks, 3 left to panels, 5 same-blow heavies left without).


## Crack heights are kept near the ground (2026-11-01)

A crack strip's vertices are at the drawn ground's height (`GroundField.ground_at`), which on the tile ground reads the planet's tiles at the frame in force. One wrong read (a tile not loaded yet, a frame turned since the set was queued) can put a vertex far above its neighbours and stand the strip up as a tall, constant-width column (the likely source of Orb's green tube after a landing: a tier-4 fighter's standing crack on plains; not reproduced on the tile ground, see the park's README). The colour is Art's plains crack, a dark green (`data/art/effects.json` `by_biome.plains.crack` #2a4a24), not a default; the default is the near-black #211f22. Vertices are now kept within `CRACK_UP_MAX` (400) above and `CRACK_DOWN_MAX` (1,500) below the sim's ground at their x (`WorldTerrain.groundY`), and a non-finite read falls back to it. A crack on the plane (z = 0) is unchanged, since its drawn height is that ground.
