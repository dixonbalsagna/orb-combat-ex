# VFX water effects

Owner: VFX Director. 2026-10-01. From Orb's words on the ocean skipping: "looks great, and i'd like to see more dramatic splash effects." Presentation only: nothing here writes the sim's state, no `S.rng`, the gameplay hash is unchanged. Code: `render/vfx/water.gd` (class `VfxWater`, held by the hub as `hub.water`), spray and foam bits in `render/vfx/debris.gd`, the droplet shape in `shaders/shard.gdshader`. Numbers: `data/vfx/water.json` (every key also has a default in `water.gd`; `effects_check.gd` asserts the two agree). Flag: `hub.water_enabled`, default on.

## What each event does now

| Event | Effect | Scales with |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `skim {x, y, spd, n}` (a skip off the sea) | A fan of 14 to 40 spray streaks thrown up and forward along the travel, a tail of 4 to 13 foam puffs thrown up and back, one thin expanding ring on the surface. | Raw speed `spd` and the nearest fighter's tier (`scale`). Each later skip is 15% smaller (`skip_decay`), so a skipping stone reads as losing energy. |
| `splash {n >= 10}` (a plunge: 12, or a ground impact at sea: 14) | A crown of 22 to 80 streaks in a narrow cone, a column of foam 300 to 3500 units high, two rings, then a smaller jet 0.28 s later when the cavity closes. | The fighter's speed at entry and tier. Column height is a quarter of the speed in units. |
| `splash {n >= 10}` **with World's floor on** (`WorldFill.floorOn()`; Game Design rulings 2026-10-30 rows 1, 7 and 11: a body that meets the sea or a lake lands on the sheet, or is slammed flat on it) | The sheet's splash (`water.slap`), not the plunge: spray thrown out both ways in a flat fan (14 to 40 streaks at 8 to 50 degrees, not a column), a short jet where he hit, foam running 140 to 560 units out along the surface, and two flat rings spreading on it (one under reduced motion). No rebound. The grapple's down throw (a `cue` `grapple_end` `thrown_down` in the same tick, its target standing at the splash) is cut from `slap.throw_speed` and is 1.3 times bigger. Off with the floor, or with `hub.sheet_splash_enabled` false: the plunge as above. | A landing: the fighter's speed at the end of the last tick (the sim has slowed him by the time the event arrives) and his tier. A throw: a fixed speed and the thrower's tier. |
| `splash {n < 10}` (a skip's own 8, a beam's 3) | Not drawn here: the skim event and the beam path carry those. | n/a |
| `beamSplash {x}` (a beam sample close to the surface) | Raking spray: a share of the samples (30%, at most 4 throws a tick) throws 4 streaks forward along the beam, and every second throw a foam puff. | The beam's power (the `S.beams` entry nearest to x) and its direction. |
| Wake (every tick, from the fighters' state) | A fighter at 2200 u/s or more, mostly horizontal, within 160 units of the surface throws two spray streaks back and up, and a foam puff every fourth tick. Free flight and launches alike. | Speed and tier. |

Colours are Art's ocean dust ramp (`data/art/effects.json`: ocean light, mid, shadow), with a one pixel darker rim under every droplet so the pale spray reads on a pale sky. A streak is a stretched cel droplet along its velocity (shard shape 7); it falls at 1200 u/s squared and vanishes when it is back at the surface.

## Budgets

- Spray streaks alive: 260 at quality high, thinned with quality (`0.5 + 0.5 x` the quality share: about 175 at low, fewer with reduced motion). The cap is exact: a streak is counted when thrown, and the count is recomputed after the jobs run.
- At most 60 water bits thrown a tick. All water bits live in the shared debris pool (460 in all, see `effect-budgets.md`), so water adds no draw call: one MultiMesh draw for puffs, shards and rings together.
- Counts are at quality high; medium is 0.7, low 0.35, reduced motion halves again (the shards' factors).
- Cost scene: `worst_case.gd --sea` (a fighter raking the sea at 9000 u/s, a skip every 20 ticks, a plunge every second, a power-4 beam sweeping 14 samples a tick, and the wake, all at once). Numbers in `effect-budgets.md`.

## Before and after

Real sim, seed 3, launched over open sea. "Before" has `water_enabled` off, which leaves only Rendering's own splash and spray (the reference consumer's `ImpactFx`); "after" has both.

| | Before | After |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Skip, 3 ticks in (6500 u/s, tier 2) | ![](img/water-skim_t3-before.png) | ![](img/water-skim_t3-after.png) |
| Skip, 10 ticks in (a second, smaller skip) | ![](img/water-skim_t10-before.png) | ![](img/water-skim_t10-after.png) |
| Plunge, 3 ticks in (a dive at 3800 u/s) | ![](img/water-plunge_t3-before.png) | ![](img/water-plunge_t3-after.png) |
| Plunge, 10 ticks in | ![](img/water-plunge_t10-before.png) | ![](img/water-plunge_t10-after.png) |
| Beam raking the sea, 10 ticks in (power 3) | ![](img/water-beam_t10-before.png) | ![](img/water-beam_t10-after.png) |
| Beam, 24 ticks in | ![](img/water-beam_t24-before.png) | ![](img/water-beam_t24-after.png) |

The beam "before" shows nothing because the harness stages `S.beams` and `beamSplash` events directly and Rendering's `ImpactFx` is not in that path; in a real match its own beam splash adds a few small droplets.

Pictures: `godot --path . --script res://render/vfx/tools/water_shots.gd -- --out=DIR [--nowater] [--case=skim|plunge|beam] [--tier=1..4] [--zoom=0.3]`.

## At the camera pitch

Water is drawn flat on the fighter plane like the other effects, so at the 49 degree camera a column reads 0.66 as tall (the EP's standing note). Re-shoot once Orb picks an angle.

## Planned for the knocked-about events (the ground ones are built: earth-plan.md)

Game Design's knocked-about rules (skid, bounce, tumble, lip launches, the tech) added the sim events `left_ground`, `bounce`, `land`, `tumble_end` and `journey_end` (World's ground contact, on in HEAD since 2026-10-01); the ground effects for them are built in earth.gd (see earth-plan.md), and a water bounce is the existing `skim`. The plan was: each is a new case in `water.gd` reading the same data keys, no new pools.

- `skip` (a body bouncing off the water): the same function as `skim`, with `spd` the body's speed and `n` the bounce count, so a tumbling body's skips decay the same way. Nothing new to draw.
- `bounce` on dry ground at a crater lip: the same machinery with the dirt ramp (`VfxPalette.dust(biome)`) and a kill height at the ground, a short fan of chips and dust thrown along the lip's tangent, same `scale_of`.
- `left_ground` (a lip launch): a small plume at the lip thrown along the launch vector, plus the trail's break ring; leaving the sea is a plunge in reverse (a column rising as the body leaves the water).
- `land` at sea: a plunge sized by the landing speed (the sim sends `splash` n 12 for a plunge today; if `land` replaces it, route it to `plunge`). On dry ground it is the existing impact effects.
- If the events carry the body's depth `z`, the spray takes it; today water sits on the fighter plane.
- When they land: the same `water_enabled` flag, the same budgets, and an `effects_check.gd` case for each (a skip n=1 against n=5, a lip bounce throwing dirt, a landing at sea routed to a plunge).

## For Rendering and Tools

- Rendering's reference consumer still draws its own ripples, droplets and wake. The two stack, which is what the "after" pictures show. If Orb prefers VFX's alone, `ImpactFx`'s skim spray and splash should be skipped while `host.vfx.water_enabled` is on (a one-line guard on their side).
- `data/vfx/water.json` has no schema in `tools/schemas/map.json`: the validator reports one warning, "no schema for this folder". Tools to add one.
