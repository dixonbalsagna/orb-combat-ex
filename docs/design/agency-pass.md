# The agency pass: rules from Orb's first two-player playtest

> **Melee in the close band is now ruled by `melee-press-feel.md`** (Orb's approved prototype, 2026-10-04): every press is a blow, brawls are magnetic, and both fighters strike at once. Where this page disagrees with it about a close brawl (the styles read from five presses, the blur's knock-back ender, the tapped lone heavy that launches), that page is the newer rule. It also holds the five stances by button (§10), the signatures in three tiers (§11, which replaces the signature limit of §5 here) and the brake's move to LT (§12). Everything else at range here stands.

Owner: Game Design. Orb played two local matches with a second player on 2026-10-02, answered questionnaire 14, and then picked from the pitches (`docs/ep/vision.md`, "Orb's picks after the pitches"). This page is the rules that follow. Three parts are **provisional** because Orb wants to feel them in play first: the signature limit (§5), the escape (§6) and top-tier speed (§8). Every number is a starting value for data.

**Where the pillars bend.**
- *Pillar 2 (stances, not combos)* bends toward the player. The director still choreographs, but the player sets the recipe and earns the ending (§2).
- *Pillar 3 (never out of range)* holds, with one change of meaning: an attack always **arrives**, but the defender is no longer frozen while it comes (§1).

## 1. The ranged press: three bands

**The problem, in Orb's words:** "pressing a single attack key at any distance essentially locks both fighters from performing actions as the attacker flies in and performs the attack."

**Two rules under everything here.**
1. **A strike never exists at range.** No strike is thrown at a rival who is out of reach. QA tests it as a hard rule.
2. **The exchange starts at the wind-up.** Nothing is decided until the first blow's wind-up, in every band. Until then the defender is free.

### The bands

An icon by the fighter shows which band he is in, so a press never surprises.

| Band | Distance | A physical press does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Close** | Within 3 bh | Strikes at once, as today |
| **Mid** | 3 to 12.5 bh | **A short lunge:** about a third of a second of travel (20 ticks at most), then the wind-up. The stick picks the entry, as it does up close: toward rushes, level steps in, away backsteps |
| **Far** | Beyond 12.5 bh | **Tap to taunt, hold to charge** |

With RB held, a press fires a blast in any band (§5).

### The far taunt is a challenge

- A tap plays his taunt: a voice line with a face cut-in, over 45 ticks. He keeps flying while he talks.
- **If the opponent presses attack during it, the challenge is answered.** Both rush and meet in the middle: a fist clash if either pressed heavy, and otherwise a blur exchange, decided on the pulse.
- **If it is ignored, the taunter keeps the line:** he gets the taunt's credit (§3).
- It can't be punished. That is why its meter is rationed (§3).

### The button picks the charge

Holding the attack button in the far band charges.

| | **A held light** | **A held heavy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Before he goes** | 8 ticks (12 before §12) | 16 ticks (24 before §12) |
| **The flight** | Fast: about 0.3 to 1.0 s by distance | Slower: about 0.5 to 1.4 s |
| **Changing his mind** | Releasing the button stops the charge at no cost. That is the feint | Committed once he goes. Only a dodge-cancel (15 ki) stops it |
| **Blasts on the way** | Any blast that lands stops him | He shrugs off light blasts and volleys, taking half their damage. A charged shot or a beam still stops him |
| **On arrival** | A light opener, into a brawl | A charged heavy. If it lands clean it **earns a launch** (§3) |
| **Cost** | None | 4 ki, a heavy's cost |

**The defender is free during any charge.** He can guard, dodge, press attack to meet it (a trade or a clash at contact), fire, or boost away (§6).

**Pillar 3 holds:** a charge always reaches a rival who doesn't answer.

## 2. Reading presses: the fight alchemist

Presses are ingredients in the ongoing string, not a queue.

### The frame

- **The window is each fighter's last 5 presses.** It clears when 90 ticks pass with no press (§20; presses no longer expire one by one).
- **The recipe display is a setting.** When on, a small strip names the current recipe and shows the flow count.
- **The stick picks the launch's direction, and the director snaps it to the most dramatic nearby target** within about 45 degrees: a building, water or a crater, inside the collateral budgets. With no tilt the director picks freely. In a juggle each return blow reads the tilt again. Depth stays the choreographer's (ADR 0009).

### The three styles

The number of heavies in the last five presses sets the style, and the last press sets the ending.

| Heavies in the last five | Style | What plays |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| None | **Blur** | A rapid run of light strikes |
| One to three | **Combo** | Lights with heavy accents that crack a guard and push the rival back |
| Four or five | **Power** | Big, slow blows, charged by holding |

| The last press | The ending |
| :--- | :--- |
| A light | It stays a brawl |
| A heavy | A knock-back, or a launch when one was earned (§3) |

**Direction.** Toward presses forward and prefers the close strikes: elbows, knees, the headbutt and the shoulder. Level stands and trades. Away gives ground: dodges, a heavy to knock the rival off, and blasts.

### Timing upgrades each style (Orb's pick)

Each style works by feel at its base level. Timing lifts it.

| Style | Base | With timing | The upgrade |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blur** | Mashing: more strikes, less damage each, and the weak ender (§13 and §14.4) | A **steady** mash: evenly spaced, and each press within 2 ticks of a blow landing, four in a row (§20) | **A perfect blur:** every strike lands clean, and it closes with its own ender, a burst that knocks the rival back. The player doesn't press for that ender: the blur plays it, and it is a knock-back, never a launch |
| **Power** | A held blow: more damage and a longer wind-up | **Released on the flash,** within 6 ticks of the flash at full charge | **A guard-breaking blow.** Against a guard it breaks it. Unguarded, it earns a launch |
| **Combo** | Presses in any rhythm | **Taps in time,** each within 4 ticks of a blow landing | **Clean and hard:** each timed strike does 15% more |

### Timing earns the ending: the flow count

- Each timed press adds 1 to the fighter's **flow,** up to 5.
- A press off the beat sets it back to 0, and so do 90 ticks without a press.
- **A heavy ender after a string launches only at flow 3 or more,** in the direction the stick picks. Below that it is a knock-back. Flow governs only this earner: the other three in §3 stay (§18).
- **At flow 5 the ender is a showcase ender,** with the panel and 20% more impact wear (Combat's proposal, confirmed).

### The running mix

The game keeps each player's mix over their last 20 presses and compares it with their latest five.
- **A change-up** breaks his habit. Its first blow has a wind-up 3 ticks shorter.
- **A repeat** matches it. Wind-ups grow by 2 ticks for each repeat, up to 6 (`control-rules.md` §6).

### When both fighters attack

| | He plays blur or combo | He plays power |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I play blur or combo** | A blur exchange: traded strikes, decided on the pulse | My lights land first. Three clean ones before his blow lands stop it; otherwise it comes through |
| **I play power** | The mirror of that | A fist clash on the pulse, or **Blow for Blow** when both are in time (below) |

- **A timed press wins its trade beat** (Combat's proposal, confirmed).
- **A cross-counter on the last beat is a double slide:** both blows land together, both fighters slide apart for half the knock-back distance, and nobody wins the exchange.

### Blow for Blow (the named set piece Orb asked for)

Two fighters trade heavy blows in turn, driving each other back and forth across the ground, neither giving way, until one misses the beat. "Blow for Blow" is an in-house label only; Narrative picks the player-facing name. Legal's twelve staging rules apply (`docs/legal/agency-pass-screen.md`), and Combat's content is in `docs/combat/alchemist-recipes.md` §2.

| Part | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Trigger** | Both fighters release a power blow on the flash in the same exchange |
| **The turns** | They take turns. On his turn a fighter presses heavy on the beat, inside an 8-tick window |
| **A blow on the beat** | One of his own heavies at ×0.7 of a heavy. **Each turn uses a different strike and a different place,** and the wear goes to that place's region: the ribs, flank and chest to the core; the shoulder plate to the arms; the hip and thigh to the legs. The other fighter takes it in his own brace and stays on his feet. Then it is his turn |
| **They travel** | Each blow drives both fighters along the ground, and the answer drives them back the other way, further each time: 40 units on the first turn, rising by 8 a turn to 96 on the eighth (Combat's numbers, confirmed) |
| **The beat** | 40 ticks between blows at first, 4 ticks shorter each turn, and never under 24 |
| **The end** | The first to miss the beat, or to guard or dodge, gives way. The other lands the last blow as an earned launch, with the panel and 25% more impact wear |
| **Limits** | At most 8 turns, then both slide apart with no winner. It counts as a big set piece, so at most one per 20 s (`rule-of-cool.md` §1) |
| **A region breaking** | A blow that breaks a region ends it at once, and the striker has won the exchange. In the turns that can only be the core, which puts him on the brink: limb wear stops at battered and spills into the core, as always. The last blow is the only one that can be a crippling blow |
| **Mood** | +8 at the start and +3 for each blow |
| **The AI** | It hits 40%, 65% or 85% of beats by difficulty |

Legal screens the staging before it is built. It must be ours and not a known scene's.

### What a player can always predict

1. The weight of my next blow is the weight I pressed.
2. More presses give more strikes.
3. Ending on a heavy sends him away. Ending on a light keeps him close.
4. Holding is bigger and slower. Mashing is faster and weaker. Timing makes each of them better.
5. Staying in time earns the big ending.
6. The stick decides which way he flies.
7. What I don't choose is the limb, the exact strike and the camera.

### What QA measures: "consistent timing should give the fighter a substantial edge"

Scripted players in a mirror match, with everything else equal.

| Match | Target |
| :--- | :--- |
| A timed player (hits 80% of beats) against a masher | The timed player wins **72 to 82%** |
| A timed player against a style-only player (holds and mixes sensibly, never on the beat) | The timed player wins **62 to 70%** |
| A style-only player against a masher | The style-only player wins 55 to 62% |

The masher bands against the AI stay as they are (`control-rules.md` §6).

## 3. Brawls, launches and taunts

### Launches

**Orb's rule: 30% of brawls end in a launch.** The band is 25 to 35% of exchanges, against 64.6% today.

| How an exchange ends | Target |
| :--- | :--- |
| The brawl continues, with both fighters in reach | 40 to 50% |
| A knock-back | 20 to 30% |
| A launch | 25 to 35% |

**A launch is earned by four things only:**
1. a charged, held heavy that lands, including a heavy charge from the far band (§1);
2. the ender of a full string, which is a heavy ender at flow 3 or more (§2);
3. a heavy pressed with a stick direction, landing clean;
4. winning a clash, Blow for Blow included.

- A guard break and a riposte now end in a knock-back. Meter never buys a launch.
- Signatures, finishers, crippling blows and throws are set pieces with their own rules, and still launch.
- If the share misses the band, QA tunes the third earner first, by how clean the heavy has to land.

**Knock-backs** (Combat's distances, confirmed): 3.5, 5, 6.5 and 8 bh at tiers 1 to 4.
- Under 4 bh he slides upright. At 4 bh and over he drops low, brakes with a hand and cuts a trench.
- An obstacle stops a slide early, as a light brunt inside the collateral budgets.
- In the air he drifts back and rights himself.

**Launches pay more.** With about half as many, each launch's impact wear rises so launches keep their share of the damage. QA sizes the factor, at about ×1.6, and re-tunes match length.

**Slide and tumble destruction: 4 of 5** (Orb). It is a central feature.
- Every long slide cuts a trench, and World widens trenches by about a third.
- A tumble leaves a line of divots, where it left only scuffs before.
- Both damage what they cross, inside the tier's budget and the journey's one-impact cap (`balance-targets.md` §20).

### Taunts feed meters, with a guard against farming

Orb leans yes, and will revisit it in play.

| Taunt | What it pays |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The close taunt** (1 s, and it can be hit) | In full, as ruled: Pride +6, heat +10, Wrath +8 or Hunger +5, once per 15 s (`control-rules.md` §4) |
| **A far taunt that is answered** | The same full value, to the taunter, whoever wins the clash. **Only an attack press during the taunt answers it** (the EP's ruling). Taunting back is a reply in the dialogue, but for meter each of those taunts counts as ignored |
| **A far taunt that is ignored** | Half the value for the first, a quarter for the second and an eighth for the third. **Nothing after the third,** until the two fighters have traded blows |

The line and the face cut-in always play, whatever the meter does. Narrative's dialogue director keeps them fresh: a call within 4 s of the rival's is a reply to it, no line repeats inside a match, and after three calls in 10 s he only gestures for a while.

## 4. Air recovery: hold to brake

**Orb's rule:** hold to brake, it costs ki, and harder hits take longer.

> **The button is now LT,** the manoeuvre stance: a hold brakes and a tap techs (`melee-press-feel.md` §10 and §12). The rate and the rest of this section stand.

- **The input:** hold the boost (§6) during a launch flight. It is the boost turned against his own flight.
- **The cost:** 20 ki for each second it is held.
- **Harder hits take longer.** The brake slows him at a fixed rate, so the time and the ki follow the launch's speed: about 0.35 s and 7 ki for a light launch, and about 1 s and 20 ki for a hard one.
- **He has control again** when his speed drops under a third of the launch's speed. He can also let go early and fly on.
- **An earned launch can't be braked for its first 12 ticks,** so the hit reads.
- **It never works** on a crippling blow's launch, a finisher's launch or a hard impact (§7).
- **With no ki he can't brake.**
- **Counterplay:** the brake shows as a flare against his direction of flight. A follow-up can arrive before he stops, and he stops in a place the attacker can read.
- A small steer is free: the stick bends his path by up to 15 degrees.
- The ground recovery stays: a dodge tap on a bounce or in a tumble, for 15 ki (`balance-targets.md` §20).
- The AI brakes on 20%, 50% or 80% of chances by difficulty.

## 5. Energy: the first slice

Orb will make no final calls on beams until the energy system can be played: "I want to personally experience how the expansion of ranged blasts change the gameplay." So this section specifies the first slice to build, and marks what is provisional.

### What the first slice contains

| Input | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hold RB** | The attack buttons become energy. Released, they are physical. This replaces the toggle |
| **RB and light** | **Blast volleys.** A tap is a bolt, and repeated taps are a volley. Volleys that cross **trade:** they cancel in pairs, and what is left of the bigger one lands |
| **RB and heavy** | **A charged blast.** Holding charges it for up to 30 ticks. Held on past the full charge, it becomes **a short beam** of about half a second, for 20 ki |
| **The signature** | As now: the power trigger and its button, for 45 ki |

Blast speeds and ranges are in `moveset-rules.md` §11, and blasts use the tier factor on structures (`balance-targets.md` §15).

### Which beam plays come first

| Order | Play | How |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First slice** | Blast volleys that trade | As above |
| | Both fire at once | A signature or short beam answered by one in its wind-up: a struggle on the pulse |
| | Walk through on guard | Guard held with the stick toward wades through at guard damage. With a perfect block it is clean |
| | Split the beam | A perfect block with the stick level |
| | Swat it away | A perfect block with the stick away. The director picks where it lands |
| **Second slice** | Fire late into an incoming beam | An answer in the first 20 ticks after the beam fires. The struggle starts at −10 for the late fighter |
| **Later** | Block, then push back | A heavy energy press while a held guard is taking a beam: a struggle that starts at −15 |
| | Feed a struggle with a second charge | Once per struggle, 10 ki between pulses for +5 |

### Beam defence: 3 of 5

| Answer | Today | Now |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dodge** | A roll, about 55% | **No roll.** A dodge tap in the last 14 ticks of the wind-up or the first 6 ticks of the beam avoids it |
| **Perfect block** | The last 10 ticks of the wind-up | The last **12** ticks, for beams only |
| **Held guard** | Reduced damage | Unchanged |

### The signature limit (provisional: Orb's to revisit)

> **Replaced on 2026-10-04** by `melee-press-feel.md` §11: every stance has a signature, in three tiers of cost (25, 45 and 75 ki), with one shared cooldown of at most 3 s and no cap. The 40% damage cut and the 30% band below are kept.

Orb disliked the 120 s cooldown and set the slider to 15 s. The mildest limit that should still keep fights from being led by beams is:

- **45 ki and a 15 s cooldown per fighter;**
- **a signature's damage cut by about 40%,** because there will be several times as many;
- **one band for QA to watch:** signatures deal at most 30% of a match's damage.

Ki is now spent on much more than beams (the boost, the brake, bursts, specials and short beams), so the true rate should sit well under the ceiling of one every 15 s. QA reports signatures per match from the first slice.

**If fights still become beam-led,** the next lever is a rising cost and not a longer timer: each signature fired in the last 45 s adds 15 ki to the next. A gauge filled by fighting is the stronger alternative, and it stays on the table for when Orb has played the slice.

The pause budget doesn't grow: beam set pieces play live once the bank is spent (`spec-wounds.md` §8b).

## 6. Flight and escape (provisional)

> **A further way to leave a brawl since 2026-10-05:** the zip away, a parting blow and a long exit for 20 or 30 ki (`melee-press-feel.md` §2c). It sits beside the dodge, the boost and Escape, and that page says how the four differ.

Orb: "I need to feel how this works in game... lets get something that works now and then work on it when we have more combat systems in place." This is the simple version to build now. Every number sits in one data block so it can change.

- **One dedicated control boosts,** as Controls proposes. Held, he flies at about 2.2 times normal speed in any direction. The dodge stays a separate tap.
- **It drains 12 ki a second,** and ki doesn't return while boosting.
- He can't guard, charge or fire while boosting.
- **Empty ki leaves him exhausted** for 2 s: no boost, no dodge, and three quarters speed.
- "Escape" isn't a stance any more, and the pursuit roll is switched off.

**Two ways to stop an escape, in this version:**

| Tool | How | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chase and catch** | Boost after him and attack when in reach | The strike lands. A catch is decided by reach, not by a roll |
| **A blast from behind** | A blast that hits a boosting fighter | It knocks him out of the boost and down |

Exhaustion is the third, and it comes free with the drain. **The intercept** (a fast curved flight that arrives ahead of him, for 20 ki) waits for a later slice.

A charge from the far band (§1) catches a fighter who isn't boosting. Against one who is, it becomes the chase.

## 7. Hard impacts: buried in the crater

**Orb's rule:** the fighter is buried, and the attacker gets a free follow-up.

| Question | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The threshold** | By the crater. An impact that digs a crater at least **1.75 bh** deep buries him, or 1.5 bh for a special's impact (World's build: about two burials a match). Smaller impacts keep the bounce, the skid and the tumble |
| **What happens** | No hop, no bounce and no skid. He stops at the bottom |
| **The free follow-up** | The attacker gets **one blow that can't be answered,** if he strikes within 40 ticks: a heavy or a blast into the crater. It lands clean, deepens the crater and doesn't launch |
| **How long he is down** | 60 ticks. After the follow-up, or from tick 40 without one, he can guard |
| **How he gets out** | He rises by himself at 60 ticks. A burst throws him out earlier, but not before the follow-up's 40 ticks are over. He comes out with 10 ticks of safety |
| **Limits** | One follow-up per burial. The same fighter can't be buried twice inside 5 s. The brake (§4) can't stop a hard impact |

This replaces the single small hop after a very hard slam (`balance-targets.md` §20).

## 8. Showing power without more speed

Orb noted that fighters "almost get a little too fast when max transformation is reached", and gave no yes or no on a speed curve. **The curve is held: nothing changes in the speed numbers for now.** Orb asked instead for more ways to show power: "rocks levitating around a powered-up individual look cool". VFX leads that list. This is the rules-side view of what each tier should read as.

**The principle:** each tier adds a new **kind** of evidence, not more of the same. Power is weight (pillar 4).

| Tier | What it should read as | What the rules already give it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | A strong fighter. The world doesn't react to him | Knock-backs of 3.5 bh; small craters; a beam that wounds a house and doesn't level it |
| **2** | The ground notices | Knock-backs of 5 bh; the first trenches; two bounces; small formations can be broken through |
| **3** | The surroundings move | The world reacts: rubble lifts when he charges, windows blow out, clouds part. Impacts reach 1.6 times as far. Burying impacts begin. Orbit launches |
| **4** | The sky and the horizon answer | Reach 2.8 times as far; the sky pales; cracks spread under him when he stands; the round-the-world hit; a finisher that wrecks a district |

**More rules-side signals that cost no speed,** for VFX and Camera to draw from:
- a longer hit-stop on his heavy blows, by a tick or two a tier;
- a guarding rival slides further back from each blocked blow;
- his charge lifts rubble over a wider radius. Legal's rule holds: a gentle lift with weight, never a ring of rocks;
- a wider camera at tiers 3 and 4, so the scale shows;
- deeper sound, with delayed booms from far impacts.

If the top tier still reads as too fast once these are in, the curve is ready: +8%, +14% and +18% by tier in place of +10%, +20% and +30%, with a ×1.25 cap.

## 9. The build order

Each slice is playable by itself. Energy comes early, as Orb asked.

| # | Slice | What the player gets | Who builds it |
| ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **The free approach** | The exchange starts at the wind-up. Three bands with the icon, the mid lunge, tap to taunt and hold to charge, and the answered challenge | Encounter (the director's read, bands and charges); Controls (tap and hold at range); Simulation (the charge state); Combat (lunge, charge and taunt pieces) |
| 2 | **Energy, first slice** | Hold RB, volleys that trade, the charged blast and short beam, the provisional signature limit, the first five beam plays and the new defence windows | Controls (RB held); Combat (the energy pieces); Encounter (blast exchanges and the struggle on the pulse); Simulation (blasts in flight, ki); World (blast damage to structures) |
| 3 | **Boost, escape and the brake** | The boost control with its ki drain and exhaustion, the two ways to stop an escape, and hold to brake | Controls; Simulation; Encounter (the AI's use of them) |
| 4 | **The alchemist** | The window of 5, the three styles, the timing upgrades, the flow count, the endings and the four earners, the stick's launch direction, and the recipe display | Encounter (the reader and composer); Combat (endings and trade beats); Controls (reading rhythm); Simulation (state); World (the slide on the feet and its trench) |
| 5 | **Clashes and Blow for Blow** | The fist clash and blur exchange on the pulse, and the named set piece | Combat; Encounter; Simulation |
| 6 | **Buried, and destruction at 4 of 5** | Burying impacts with the free follow-up, wider trenches and tumble divots | World; Simulation; Encounter |
| 7 | **Energy, second slice** | The late answer, block then push back, feeding a struggle, and the intercept | Encounter; Combat; Controls |

QA baselines after each slice. The timing bands in §2 are measured from slice 4.

## 10. What this changes elsewhere

| Rule today | Becomes |
| :--- | :--- |
| The exchange is fixed at the press (`stance-matrix.md` R8) | It is fixed at the first blow's wind-up (§1) |
| A press at any range rushes | Three bands; a strike never exists at range (§1) |
| A queue of up to 3 presses (`control-rules.md` §6) | The window of 5, three styles, timing upgrades and the flow count (§2) |
| 40 to 65% of exchanges end in a launch, and a guard break or riposte launches (`balance-targets.md` §10) | 25 to 35%, earned four ways (§3) |
| Taunts feed meters, close only (`control-rules.md` §4) | The far taunt feeds too, rationed (§3) |
| Recovery only on the ground (`balance-targets.md` §20) | Hold to brake in the air as well (§4) |
| A 120 s signature cooldown (`balance-targets.md` §13) | 45 ki and 15 s, provisional (§5) |
| RB toggles energy (ADR 0008) | RB is held (§5) |
| A dodge against a beam is a roll | A timed dodge always works (§5) |
| The escape stance and its slip roll (`balance-targets.md` §13) | A boost on ki, provisional (§6) |
| One hop after a hard slam | Buried, with a free follow-up (§7) |

**Not in this page:** a glancing bounce on a mountain gaining too much momentum is World's to tune (a bounce must never add speed), and the split-screen camera is Camera's.

## 11. Rulings on the first live build (`654acff`, 2026-10-02)

The build has earned launches at ×1.6 force (about 28% of decided exchanges), knock-backs, the exchange starting at the wind-up with the range bands, a slope speed cap of 1.25, and World's skid fix: skids run twice as long and cut deeper furrows.

| # | Question | Ruling |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Walls end 21.5% of launches,** against a band of 5 to 15%. Longer skids reach more walls | **The band stays, and World pulls two levers.** The wall slope rises from 0.8 to **1.0**, so a skid rides up slopes of up to 45 degrees and can fly off the crest. And a skid that meets a wall at a speed under **600** just halts, with no stop-impact: it counts as halted, not as a wall. World re-measures. If walls are still over 15% after both, the band moves to 8 to 18% |
| 2 | **Speed lines** fell from 17 to 7.8 a minute with the new rhythm. The EP let a follow-up heavy after a launch keep its own streak, which gives 10.9 | **Confirmed.** The rule is one streak per exchange, plus one for a follow-up heavy after a launch. The band is 8 to 14 a minute |
| 3a | **The interim far tap** flies in at about the old speed until the taunt and the held charges exist | **Confirmed as interim.** It is the old rush with the exchange starting at the wind-up. Slice 1's taunt and charges replace it (§1) |
| 3b | **A guard press during a rival's approach** starts the 20-tick perfect-block lockout today | **It shouldn't.** Raising a guard as someone flies in is the natural thing to do, and it must not cost the perfect block. The lockout starts only when a guard press lands during a visible wind-up and misses the window, or when two guard presses come within 20 ticks of each other. A single press with no wind-up showing starts nothing |
| 4 | **A patient player starts 22 to 30% of exchanges** against a fast masher, down from 33 to 42% | **A small floor until the alchemist lands.** When both fighters have a press waiting at an exchange boundary, the one who didn't start the last exchange starts this one. Controls' measure should return to 35 to 50% for a patient player who has pressed. The alchemist's trades replace this rule, because there both presses play |
| 5 | **The embed threshold** | **Recorded as World built it:** a crater 1.75 bh deep, or 1.5 bh for a special's impact. That is about two burials a match. It replaces the single 1.5 bh in §7 |
| 6a | **A seeking shot is not stopped by ground** between the fighters | **Confirmed.** It keeps "energy reaches at any range" true on a planet with hills. VFX arcs it over the terrain. A shot that is dodged or loses its target carries on as a straight shot, and that one does hit the ground and structures, with the tier factor |

**6b. The first numbers for shots** (`data/fight/shots.json`), with Combat's rule that a shape carries its strike's damage and never adds to it.

| Kind | Speed (units a tick) | Trade power | Damage | Ki |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Bolt | 60 | 1 | Half a light strike (§14; it was a third) | 1 |
| Volley (3 bolts) | 60 | 1 each | One and a half lights in all (§14) | 3 |
| Shard spread (5) | 50, up to 1,200 units | 1 each | A light strike, split in five | 3 |
| Arc | 45 | 2 | ×0.8 of a heavy | 8 |
| Burst | None, within 150 units | 3 | ×0.8 of a heavy | 8 |
| Lob | A fixed 36-tick arc | 3 | A heavy, over an area | 8 |
| Charged shot | 90 | 3 | ×0.6 of a heavy on a tap, rising to ×1.25 of a heavy at 30 ticks of charge, which knocks back (§14) | 8 |

- Every seeking shot arrives within 45 ticks.
- **Trades:** shots of opposing fighters cancel power for power. Bolts cancel in pairs, and a charged shot eats three bolts and ends.
- A held guard takes a blast at the guard's rate, like a strike.
- A heavy charge from the far band (§1) shrugs off shots of power 1 at half damage. Power 2 and above stop it.
- These are first values. QA reports blast damage as a share of match damage from the first energy slice, and the band to start from is 15 to 30%.

## 12. Rulings on Encounter's slice 3 (the challenge and the charges, 2026-10-02)

The starts floor works: a patient player now starts 44 to 49% of exchanges, inside the band.

| # | Question | Ruling |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| a | **Matches run 80 s longer** (a median of 9:56, from 8:35). The AI charges 76 times a match, because launches leave the pair far apart about 40% of the time, and each charge is slower than the fly-in it replaced | **Both: the charges shorten, and then QA re-tunes.** A held light goes after 8 ticks and flies 0.3 to 1.0 s. A held heavy goes after 16 ticks and flies 0.5 to 1.4 s. That gives back about half the 80 s. QA then raises k to bring the median to between 7:00 and 7:30. The band stays 6 to 8 minutes: Orb asked for five minutes or more, and nearly ten is too long. The 4 points of extra collateral are inside the bands and need no change |
| b | **The band edge.** A match opens exactly 12 bh apart, so the opening press read as far and played a taunt. Encounter added 0.1 bh of slack | **Move the edge, and keep the opening distance.** The far band starts beyond **12.5 bh**, so the opening press is a lunge. Each band edge also gets **0.5 bh of hysteresis,** so the icon doesn't flicker when the fighters hover on a line. The entrance still needs its 12 bh |
| c | **A rival's press during a held heavy's hold** turns it into a meeting | **Intended.** The defender is free during any charge, and pressing attack is one of his answers. Both rush and meet in a fist clash. The fighter who was already charging enters it at **+5,** for the charge he had built. Winning a clash earns a launch, so he doesn't lose his reward by being met |

## 13. A light-only player can always finish a fight (urgent ruling, 2026-10-02)

**What QA found** on the first agency build (`docs/qa/baseline-agency1.md`). The endings are in band (launch 28.6%, knock-back 20.4%, stay 51.0%), but:
- a masher wins 0 of 100 against the easy, medium and hard AI, where the bands are at least 60% against easy and 35 to 50% against medium;
- two lights-only players never finish: 0 of 40 matches were decided before the 15:00 cap;
- brink to KO is 128 s against 45 to 90.

**The cause is one rule.** A finisher needs decisive exchanges, and a decisive exchange has meant a launch, a clash won or a guard break. Launches now need a heavy. So a player who only presses light can wear the rival down but can never open him up or finish him.

**The fix keeps Orb's four earners and keeps "mash is a blur, weaker".** A light never launches. It doesn't need to.

| # | Rule | Data |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **A knock-back is a decisive exchange.** Being driven back means that fighter lost the exchange. It counts for the brink's set-up, for the finisher and for the mood, exactly as a launch does | The decisive list gains `knockback` |
| 2 | **A blur always closes.** When four or more lights of a string have landed, the blur plays its own ender, a knock-back the player doesn't press. This holds for plain mashing too. It is not a launch | `blur.enderAfter` 4 |
| 3 | **The plain blur's ender is the weak one.** It drives the rival back 0.6 of the tier's knock-back distance: 2.1, 3, 3.9 and 4.8 bh. The perfect blur, once timing is built, gets the full distance and its clean hits | `blur.enderDist` 0.6 |
| 4 | **A knock-back hurts.** Its skid costs half of a launch's impact wear | `knockback.wear` 0.5 |
| 5 | **Mashed lights do ×0.8 of a light each,** and no less. More strikes at 0.8 is still a weaker string than a combo | `blur.strikeMul` 0.8 |
| 6 | **A light ender never launches.** Earner 2 is still a heavy ender after four landed strikes, and with the alchemist, at flow 3 or more | No change |
| 7 | **The easy AI earns far fewer launches.** It earned 17 to 35 a match against the masher's 2. The AI's use of the four earners scales by difficulty: ×0.25 on easy, ×0.6 on medium and ×1.0 on hard. The target is at most 6 earned launches a match for the easy AI | `ai.earnerUse` 0.25, 0.6, 1.0 |

**What a light-only player can now always do:** land four lights, drive the rival back, and repeat. Each knock-back wears him, and at the brink it opens him and then finishes him.

**The other rows.**
- **Brink to KO.** With knock-backs counted, decisive exchanges go from about 29% to about 49% of the total, so the brink should fall to around 75 s. If it is still over 90 s, `brinkSetups` goes from 2 to 1.
- **Length.** QA's k +8% is accepted, for a median of about 454 s. Re-measure after rules 1 to 5, because knock-back wear shortens matches again.
- **Mood** (Calm 22.1%, Tense 61.0%). Re-measure after these rules. If Calm is still under 30%, the decay goes from 4 to 5.
- **The timing baseline** (timed against a masher 67.5%, style-only against a masher 75.0%, timed against style-only 45.0%) is recorded as the starting point. §2's bands apply once the timing rules are built.

**The bands to hit after this ruling:**
- a masher wins at least 60% against the easy AI and 35 to 50% against medium, with forms taken;
- two lights-only players finish at least 95% of matches before the time cap;
- brink to KO is 45 to 90 s.

**A met charge, until the fist clash exists.** Encounter's interim rule is confirmed: the meeting is settled by the old roll, with 10 points off the charger's chance. With no pulses yet, that stands in for the defender's timing in answering. When the fist clash is built, the pulses decide and the charger enters at +5 (§12).

## 14. Rulings on the slice 4 baseline (QA's `docs/qa/baseline-agency4.md`, 2026-10-02)

The §13 targets are met: the masher wins 99%, 37% and 0% against the easy, medium and hard AI; the lights-only mirror finishes 60 of 60; brink to KO is 65.7 s; the median is 7:21; and KAI is at 51.4%. 83 bands pass and 15 fail.

### 1. How exchanges end: the bands move, and Orb's 30 is measured where it belongs

**Measured:** launch 21.0%, knock-back 31.9%, stay 47.1%.

- **QA's bands are accepted:** launch 18 to 30%, knock-back 25 to 35%, stay 40 to 50% of decided exchanges.
- **Orb's "30% of brawls end in a launch" is a share of the endings, not of every exchange.** A brawl is a run of exchanges in reach, and it ends when the fighters are separated, by a knock-back or by a launch. Nearly half of all exchanges don't end the brawl at all. So the measure is: **of the exchanges that separate the fighters, 25 to 40% are launches.** Today that is 21.0 out of 52.9, which is 39.7%, at the top of the band.
- **The AI's earner use stays** at 0.25, 0.6 and 1.0. Raising it would push launches past Orb's number, and it would take the masher under his band against the medium AI.

### 2. Chains, exchanges and gaps

| Row | Measured | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Chains per 100 exchanges | 14.0 against 15 to 35 | **10 to 30,** as QA suggests. Strings now come from the player's presses, so the old chain count runs lower. It is replaced by a strikes-per-string measure when the timing rules land |
| Exchanges started | 26.55 a minute against a limit of 26 | **15 to 28.** Knock-backs make exchanges shorter and more frequent |
| Matches with no gap over 10 s | 92.3% against 95% | **The band stays, and the measure changes.** A gap is 10 s with no strike, blast, charge or taunt from either fighter. Blasts and far taunts are play, and they weren't being counted. If it still misses, Encounter has the AI close or fire within 6 s of a launch |

### 3. A timed player against the AI

**Measured:** 85% against the medium AI, against a band of 60 to 80%, before any timing rule exists.

**The band moves to 70 to 90%,** and a band against the hard AI is added at **40 to 60%.** The timed script stands in for a skilled player, and a skilled player should beat the default opponent most of the time. The medium AI can't be made stronger without taking the masher under 35%. When the timing rules land, QA re-measures both rows.

### 4. Lights-only fights end too fast at the brink

**Measured:** brink to KO is 26 s in the lights-only mirror, against a floor of 45 s.

**A plain blur's ender counts as half a set-up.** Opening a fighter on the brink needs two set-ups. A launch, a clash won, a guard break, a heavy's knock-back or a perfect blur's ender is worth one each. The plain blur's ender, from untimed mashing, is worth half. So a masher needs twice as many to open the rival, which keeps "mash is weaker" true at the brink as well. It is still decisive for wear and for the mood.
- Data: `setup.weight`, with 1 for everything except `blurPlain` at 0.5.
- Expected: about 45 to 55 s for a lights-only brink. The overall 65.7 s is unaffected.

### 5. The buried fighter's free follow-up

**What is live:** the free blow reaches from any distance, the buried fighter is held until the attacker arrives, and the AI never bursts out.

- **The follow-up is a dive, with a time limit and no distance limit.** The attacker presses within 40 ticks, and the director flies him to the crater at charge speed. The blow must land **within 100 ticks of the burial.** At that speed it reaches about as far as a long launch throws, so nearly every burial can be followed. If he can't arrive in time, there is no follow-up.
- **A blast is the other free blow.** With RB held, the press sends a charged shot into the crater. It arrives within 45 ticks from any distance, and it is the weaker choice.
- **The buried fighter is held until the blow lands, and never beyond tick 100.** Without a follow-up he rises at 60, as before.
- **The AI bursts out only when no follow-up is coming.** From tick 40, if the attacker hasn't pressed and is within 12 bh, the AI bursts on 20%, 50% or 80% of chances by difficulty. A burst can't escape a dive that is already on its way.

### 6. Energy

**Measured:** blasts are 4.4% of match damage against a band of 15 to 30%. With the AI firing more they reach 13.9%, but matches run a minute longer and structures lost rise to 45%, because dodged shots hit the ground with the tier factor.

Three changes, together:

| Change | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bolts hit harder** | A bolt does **half** a light, up from a third, so a volley of three is one and a half lights. A fully charged shot does ×1.25 of a heavy, and a clean hit from one is a knock-back, so it is decisive and keeps the fight moving. Blasts were too slow a way to win, which is why firing more made matches longer |
| **A missed bolt doesn't wreck buildings** | *Overridden by §15 (Orb): every shot explodes, bolts wear buildings down, and a barrage can level one.* As first ruled: a shot of power 1 that misses leaves a scorch and does no structure damage |
| **The band** | **10 to 25%** of match damage, until Orb has played it. The AI's firing rate goes to the level that reached 13.9% |

- These replace the bolt and charged rows in §11's table.
- **The provisional signature limit** gives 5.6 signatures a match between AIs, well under the ceiling. No change. KAI at 42% with it on is the floor, so QA re-centres with the placeholder `dmgMul` values.
- **Re-measure after the three changes:** match length (the minute should come back), structures lost (back toward 35 to 40%), and the blast share.

## 15. Blasts that explode, wild deflects, buildings, spray and mines (Orb, 2026-10-02)

Orb watched AI matches and likes the blasts (`docs/ep/vision.md`, "Orb on the energy blasts"). These rules follow from that. They **override §14.6's line that a missed bolt does no structure damage.** Every number is a starting value for data, and Legal screens the list.

### 15.1 Every shot ends in an explosion

A shot that hits anything, or lands, erupts into flame, smoke and sparks. The size comes from its kind and power.

| Shot | Blast radius | On the ground | Smoke |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- |
| Bolt, or one piece of a volley or shard spread (power 1) | 0.5 bh | A scorch and a small pock | 2 s |
| Arc (power 2) | 1 bh | A shallow scar | 3 s |
| Burst, lob, or a tapped charged shot (power 3) | 1.5 bh | A small crater | 4 s |
| A fully charged shot | 2 bh | A real crater, with a column of flame | 5 s |
| A mine (§15.5) | 2 bh | A real crater | 5 s |

- The radius grows with the shooter's tier: ×1.25 at tier 3 and ×1.5 at tier 4.
- **The direct hit does the shot's damage. The blast does 30% of it** to any other fighter inside the radius, the shooter included.
- Structures inside the radius take half of what a direct hit would do to them (§15.3).
- The smoke is for show. It doesn't block sight until the living-destruction rules give smoke that role.

**So a bolt is a spark and a pock, and a charged shot is a crater and a pillar of fire four times as wide.**

### 15.2 A deflect sends the shot wild

A deflected shot no longer flies back at the shooter. It flies off, lands somewhere else and explodes.

| Question | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The direction** | A seeded draw, so replays match. It is never within 30 degrees of the line back to the shooter. It is biased down and away: about 85% of deflects land within 4 to 20 bh, and about 15% arc further, to 20 to 40 bh |
| **What it can hit on the way** | Anything it meets: either fighter or a building. It can't hit the fighter who deflected it for its first 10 ticks |
| **Who answers for the damage** | The shooter, for collateral and meters. The deflector didn't choose where it went |
| **What a perfect block earns now** | No damage, +8 ki, and **a free approach:** his next charge or lunge within 45 ticks can't be stopped by any shot. The deflect turns defence into closing the gap, which is the answer to a rival who keeps him away with blasts |
| **The context deflect** (guard held at range, 10 ki, no timing) | It also sends the shot wild, with no bonus |
| **Beams** | Unchanged. A swatted beam still goes where the director picks (`rule-of-cool.md` §2) |

### 15.3 Shots and buildings

Shots meet buildings in flight (World and Simulation have the pieces).

| Shot | Damage to a structure, before the tier factor |
| :--- | ---: |
| Bolt, or one piece of a volley or shard spread | 12 |
| Arc | 40 |
| Burst | 60 |
| Lob | 80 |
| Charged shot | 60 on a tap, rising to 140 at full charge |
| Mine | 140 |

- **The tier factor applies:** ×0.25, ×0.5, ×1.0 and ×1.5 for tiers 1 to 4 (`balance-targets.md` §15). A house has 108 to 216 hp.
- **A charged shot can level a building,** from tier 3. A full charge does 140 at tier 3, which levels a small house in one and a large one in two, and 210 at tier 4. At tier 1 it does 35, which wounds.
- **A barrage eventually does it too.** A house falls to about 9 to 18 bolts at tier 3, and to 36 to 72 at tier 1.
- **A threshold before floors fail.** Until a building has lost a quarter of its hp it only shows scorch marks. After that its floors fail in stages, as with any other damage.
- **One shot levels at most one building.** The damage is credited to the shooter, and casualties stay under the collateral window (`balance-targets.md` §4b).

### 15.4 Spam sprays in a cone

**Orb:** "rapidly spamming small energy blasts should lose some accuracy, but... make sure the energy blasts are sprayed in a cone at the enemy fighter."

- **A measured bolt seeks.** Bolts fired 10 ticks or more apart always arrive on target, as today.
- **Spam builds spread.** Each bolt fired less than 10 ticks after the last adds 0.15 to his spread, up to 1.0. Bolts can't be fired faster than one every 6 ticks.
- **Spread decides how many still seek.** A bolt seeks with a chance of 1 − 0.6 × spread. So at full spread **40% still land,** and the rest fly straight inside the cone and explode around the rival.
- **The cone** is centred on the rival, with a half-angle of 6 degrees at no spread, widening to 18 at full spread.
- **It recovers** at 0.5 a second while he fires slower than one bolt per 10 ticks, or not at all.
- The draws are seeded.

**How it reads against a timed player.**

| | Bolts a second | That land | What else |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| A measured or timed player | 6 | 6 | Bolts on the beat also do 15% more (§2) |
| A spammer at full spread | 10 | 4 | Six misses a second explode on the ground and buildings behind the rival, and his ki drains at 10 a second |

Spam is the bigger show and the weaker attack, which is the same rule as mashing.

### 15.5 Mines, and more kinds of energy attack

**The mine** (Orb's idea: "a hovering energy blast mine that the enemy could walk into").

| Question | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The input** | With RB held, the context button lays a mine where he is. When the rival is within 3 bh the same press is the energy shove, as before |
| **Where it sits** | Hovering where he laid it in the air, or resting on the ground if he was standing. It doesn't move |
| **Cost** | 8 ki |
| **How many** | Up to 6 live mines per fighter, so a full field costs 48 ki: "with enough ki a fighter could leave a minefield". Laying a seventh fizzles the oldest. Mines must be at least 2 bh apart |
| **Life** | 20 s, then it fizzles with a small pop and no damage |
| **Arming** | 30 ticks, dim and then bright. Both players can always see every mine |
| **The trigger** | The rival's body within 1.5 bh. It never triggers on its owner |
| **The blast** | Power 3, a 2 bh radius, ×0.8 of a heavy, and a knock-back, so it is decisive. The owner takes the 30% blast if he is inside the radius |
| **Setting one off** | Any shot that hits a mine detonates it, from either fighter. So the owner shoots his own mine to set it off, and the rival clears mines safely from range. A physical blow on a mine detonates it in the striker's face |
| **Chain reactions** | A mine's blast sets off every mine inside its radius, 6 ticks apart, whoever owns them |
| **The 32-shot cap** | Mines count toward it. At most 12 can exist (6 a fighter), which leaves 20 slots for shots in flight |
| **Buildings** | A mine damages structures as a full charged shot does |
| **Legal's line** | Mines hover and wait. They never close in on the rival on command |

**More kinds to pick from.** One line each. The three marked are the ones to build first.

| Kind | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Splitting shot** (first) | A charged shot that bursts into five bolts in a cone on a second press. It is the answer to a rival who dodges late |
| **Rain** (first) | Fired upward. A second later a spread of bolts falls over a patch 6 bh wide, marked on the ground before it lands. It moves a rival off a spot |
| **Curving shot** (first) | A heavy shot that bends round cover or round the front of a guard, with the stick setting the side. Slower than a straight one |
| Ricochet shot | It bounces once off the ground or a wall before it seeks: a bank shot round a building |
| Burning wake | While boosting with RB held he leaves a 3 s trail that burns a pursuer who crosses it. A tool against the chase |
| Shield orb | A hovering orb that soaks 3 power of incoming shots and then pops |

### 15.6 What this does to the bands

| Band | Expected | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blasts' share of match damage** (10 to 25%) | Up, from splash damage and mines | The band stays. QA re-measures |
| **Structures lost** (25 to 50% of the front row) | Up: shots now meet buildings, spam sprays behind the rival, and deflects land anywhere | **The per-tier rates are the guard:** at most 2% of structures a minute at tier 1 and 4% at tier 2 (`balance-targets.md` §15). If they fail, lower the structure damage in §15.3. Don't shrink the explosions |
| **Civilians lost** (12 to 30%) | Little change: the collateral window and evacuation still cap it | No change |
| **Match length** (6 to 8 minutes) | Slightly shorter: splash adds damage, and a mine's knock-back is decisive | QA re-tunes k if the median leaves the band |
| **The deflect** | Zoning is stronger, because a deflect no longer hurts the shooter. The free approach is the counterweight | QA reports the win rate of a blast-heavy script against a rush-heavy one. The target is 40 to 60% |

## 16. A bolt-only player can always finish a fight (2026-10-02)

**What QA found** on the energy build (`docs/qa/baseline-energy.md`): a player who holds energy and fires a bolt every 8 ticks never finishes. He decided 0 of 40 matches against a melee masher and won 0 of 40 against the medium AI. He deals about 300 damage an exchange but earns 0.2 launches a match, so nothing he does is decisive and no finisher starts. It is the energy twin of the lights-only hole in §13. Slice 7 makes a full charged shot decisive, but a bolt-only player still has no path.

**The fix mirrors the blur's ender: a barrage closes.**

| # | Rule | Data |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **When four of a fighter's clean shots land on the rival inside 120 ticks, the fourth is a knock-back** (any kind of shot, since §21; it was four bolts inside 90 ticks). The player doesn't press for it. It is a decisive exchange, like any knock-back (§13), and never a launch | `barrage.enderAfter` 4, `barrage.window` 90 |
| 2 | **Only clean hits count.** A bolt that is guarded, deflected, or shrugged off by a heavy charge doesn't. Pieces of a volley or a shard spread count as one each | |
| 3 | **Measured bolts close hard, and spam closes weak.** If all four were measured (fired 10 ticks or more apart, with no spread), the knock-back is the tier's full distance and a full set-up. If any was spammed, it is 0.6 of the distance and half a set-up, the same as the plain blur's ender (§14.4) | `barrage.enderDist` 1.0 and 0.6; `setup.weight.barragePlain` 0.5 |
| 4 | **It can't chain at once.** After a barrage's knock-back, the count starts again, and the rival can't be knocked back by another barrage for 90 ticks | `barrage.immune` 90 |
| 5 | **The knock-back hurts as any other does:** half of a launch's impact wear | `knockback.wear`, unchanged |

**Why this fits the rules already in place.**
- *The spray* (§15.4): a spammer lands 4 of 10 bolts, so he reaches four landed bolts more slowly, and his ender is the weak one. A measured or timed player gets the strong one. Measured bolts stay accurate, and now they also pay better.
- *Mash is weaker:* the same half set-up as mashed lights, so a bolt spammer needs twice as many to open a fighter on the brink.
- *The answers are unchanged:* a held guard stops the count, a perfect block gives the free approach (§15.2), a dodge avoids the bolt, and a heavy charge walks through.

**Bands to hit:** a bolt-only player finishes at least 95% of matches against a melee masher before the cap, and wins 20 to 40% against the medium AI. Bolts alone should be a weaker plan than mixing blasts with blows.

### Two smaller rulings

- **The buried follow-up is exempt from the reach height check.** The attacker strikes down into a crater 1.75 bh deep, so the height between them is larger than a normal strike's reach by design. He must still have arrived over the crater: the sideways reach holds. QA counts these strikes apart, as it now does.
- **The hard AI's perfect blocks** are 20.3 per 100 exchanges, against 12 to 20. **The AI moves, not the band:** its rate goes from ×1.0 to **×0.9** of R5's numbers, for about 18 per 100. A perfect block is worth more now that it also gives a free approach against blasts, so the hard AI shouldn't land more of them. Data: `ai.pbRate` 0.35, 0.6 and 0.9.

## 17. Rulings on slice 7 and the mines (2026-10-02)

**A decisive shot can finish** (Encounter's `docs/director/agency-slice-7.md`). Confirmed. A full charged shot that knocks back, or a barrage's ender, is a decisive win like any other:
- it closes the shooter's own opening on the brink;
- it is a set-up against a fighter on the brink;
- against a fighter who is open, or past the time cap, it starts the shooter's finisher as its own exchange, which plays from range.

**The AI's guard against a barrage** is confirmed at 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 by difficulty. It puts a bolt-only player at 34 of 100 against the medium AI, inside the 20 to 40% band.

**A defenceless script falls fast, and that is correct.** A bolt-only player takes a lights-only masher from the brink to the KO in 9 s, because neither script defends. The brink band (45 to 90 s) is measured between AIs that do. `barrage.immune` stays at 90.

**Mines** (Simulation's `docs/architecture/shots.md` §16 to §18). Simulation's placeholders become these numbers:

| Key | Value | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `chainR` | **3 bh** at every tier | Mines are at least 2 bh apart, so with the 2 bh blast a chain could only happen at the minimum gap. At 3 bh, a field laid at normal spacing chains |
| A mine's radius (what a shot must touch to set it off) | **30 units** (0.4 bh), up from 20 | So a rival can clear a field by shooting it, as §15.5 intends |
| `fuseTicks` | **8 when a body sets it off, 0 when a shot does** | A short beep after a fighter flies into the trigger radius gives him a moment to see what he did. A shot sets it off at once |
| `awayChance` | **0.75**, confirmed | The wild shot favours the side away from the deflector |
| The wild flight's shape | `speed` ×0.8 of the shot's own; `minTicks` 12; `arcPer` 0.15 for the near landings and 0.35 for the far ones | It visibly flies off before it comes down, and the far ones arc higher |

## 18. Flow and the four earners: what a player who never times still has (2026-10-02)

> **Earner 3 is narrower since 2026-10-05** (`melee-press-feel.md` §5, Orb's questionnaire 17): a lone heavy launches with the stick only when it was held to full, 46 ticks. A tapped one lifts.

Encounter's alchemy plan (`docs/director/alchemy-plan.md`, A4) reads "flow earns the ending" as replacing the four earners. **It replaces one of them, not all four.** Orb picked the four earners in questionnaire 14, and then picked "timing earns the ending". Both hold.

| Earner (§3) | With the alchemy layer | Needs timing? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. A charged, held heavy that lands** (a far heavy charge included) | Unchanged. Released on the flash it also breaks a guard (§2) | No |
| **2. The ender of a full string** | **This is the one flow governs.** A heavy that ends a string of two or more landed strikes launches only at flow 3 or more. Below that it is a knock-back. A stick direction here only aims the launch | Yes |
| **3. A heavy with a stick direction, landing clean** | A heavy that is its own exchange, an opener and not the end of a string, launches when it lands clean with the stick tilted. Inside a string the stick only aims, so flow can't be skipped by tilting | No |
| **4. Winning a clash** (Blow for Blow included) | Unchanged | No, though Blow for Blow itself starts from timing |

**So a player who never times still has:**
- three ways to launch: a held heavy, a lone heavy with the stick, and a won clash;
- knock-backs, which are decisive (§13), so he can always open a rival on the brink and finish him;
- every set piece: signatures, finishers, crippling blows and throws.

**What timing adds:** launches at the end of his strings, the showcase ender at flow 5, and each style's upgrade.

**The mashed blur keeps its weak ender** (§13 and §14.4): after four landed lights, 0.6 of the knock-back distance and half a set-up. This replaces §2's first "no ender", which was written before §13. Encounter's plan follows the later rule, and that is right.

## 19. Rulings on slice 9 (Encounter's `docs/director/agency-slice-9.md`, 2026-10-03)

### 1. Match length: a recommendation for Orb

**Measured:** a median of 498.5 s against a band that ends at 480, a 90th percentile of 609 s against 600, and a first brink at 427.5 s against 420. Encounter shows that firing less would drop blasts under their 10% floor, and that more wear only moves time from before the brink to after it.

**Recommendation: widen the band, and leave the brink chapter alone.**

| Band | Today | Proposed while blasts and beam plays are in |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Median length | 6:00 to 8:00 | **6:00 to 8:30** (360 to 510 s) |
| First brink, median | 4:30 to 7:00 | 4:30 to 7:15 |
| 90th percentile | At most 10:00 | Unchanged |
| Brink to KO | 45 to 90 s | Unchanged |

- **Why.** Orb's standing answer is matches of five minutes or more, and 8:18 is inside that. Ranged play adds time that wasn't there before: fighters now spend part of each match apart, firing and closing. The brink chapter is the climax. Orb asked for it after it ran 4 s, and at 61 to 84 s it is inside its own band. Cutting it to meet a clock would trade the best minute of the match for an average one.
- **What it costs.** Sessions run about 20 s longer, and more matches come near the 11:00 event.
- **One small number holds the tail.** The finisher's overtime tilt (10 points less survival for each minute) starts at **7:30, not 8:00.** Late finishers land more often, which trims the longest matches and should bring the 90th percentile back under 10:00. It barely moves the median. Data: the tilt's start, 480 s to 450 s.

**If Orb would rather keep 8:00,** the number to change is `brinkSetups`, from 2 to 1. That takes about 30 s off the median. It costs the brink its two steps (the opening, then the finisher), and it puts brink to KO at about 40 s, under its 45 s floor.

### 2. The free approach after a perfect block of a shot

**As built:** for 45 ticks, any shot that meets him is shrugged off at half damage and doesn't count toward a barrage.

**Confirmed, with one amendment.** Half damage is right: it matches the heavy charge's shrug, and it leaves the rival's fire some value. The amendment keeps §15.2's promise that the approach can't be stopped:
- **if he starts a charge or a lunge inside the 45 ticks, the protection lasts until it arrives.** A far charge can take longer than what is left of the window, and it mustn't lapse halfway there;
- if he doesn't start one, it ends at 45 ticks.

### 3. The AI's firing share and barrage guard

- **Firing share 0.2, 0.4 and 0.5** (it was 0.18, 0.35 and 0.45): confirmed. Deflected shots no longer hurt the shooter, so the AI needs to fire a little more to keep blasts at 10 to 25% of match damage.
- **Medium `barrageGuard` 0.42** (it was 0.5): confirmed. Easy and hard stay at 0.2 and 0.8. The band it serves is a bolt-only player winning 20 to 40% against the medium AI.

## 20. Two rulings for the alchemy layer: "steady", and reaching the power style (2026-10-03)

### 1. A steady mash must be on the beat

**The gap:** the classifier calls a mash steady when its gaps differ by 3 ticks or less. A metronome that ignores the screen passes it, so QA's masher, who presses exactly every 8 ticks, earns the perfect blur. Orb's direction is that timing against the blows on screen is the skill, and mashing is its own style.

**The rule.** A mash earns the perfect blur only when all three hold:

| Condition | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Evenly spaced** | **Dropped** (the EP's ruling). A TRADE BLOWS opener lands its blows about 28 and 44 ticks apart, so the spacing test rejected a player who was on every contact |
| **On the beat** | Each press is within **2 ticks** of a different blow's contact |
| **Kept up** | **Four presses in a row** do so. That is now the whole test |

**And the beat has to be worth reading.** If every blur landed its blows 8 ticks apart, an 8-tick metronome would still be on the beat most of the time by luck. So **each blur string takes its cadence from a small set: 7, 8, 9 or 10 ticks between blows,** picked by a seeded draw when the string starts. The first two blows show it. A player who watches matches it. A blind metronome has the right period about one string in four, and then needs the right phase as well.

**QA bands:**
- a blind 8-tick masher earns the perfect blur on at most 20% of his strings;
- a script that presses on the contacts earns it on at least 80%.

Mashing off the beat is still the plain blur, with its weak ender (§13). That is its own style, and it is unchanged.

**Every blur follows a pattern from its first blow** (Combat's follow-up, `docs/combat/alchemist-recipes.md` §6; its option (a) is chosen). The perfect blur is only known at the fourth on-beat press, when most of the string is already thrown, so the pattern can't belong to the perfect blur alone.
- Each blur string draws a pattern together with its cadence when it starts. The first two blows show both: which limbs, and how fast.
- Combat adds the steps it needs for the two lights that fit no pattern.
- Starting the pattern only once the mash turns steady (option (b)) would make the plain blur a shapeless flurry and give the player nothing to read at the start, which is when he needs it.

**What the perfect blur adds over the plain one:**

| | Plain blur (mashed off the beat) | Perfect blur (from the fourth on-beat press) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Damage** | ×0.8 of a light for each strike | ×1.0 for each strike from that press on: they land clean |
| **The ender** | The weak one: 0.6 of the knock-back distance and half a set-up | The full one: the pattern's own closing blow, the full distance and a full set-up. It is the string's fifth blow |
| **Flow** | None, because the presses are off the beat | +1 for each on-beat press, as always |
| **The look** | The pattern, with loose contact | The same pattern locks in: full contact on every strike, a thin outline of his aura, and a rising accent in the sound for each blow |

It never launches, in either form.

**Amendment, since withdrawn: six presses, not four** (Controls' measurement, `docs/controls/agency-input.md`, A1). With four presses inside 2 ticks, QA's blind 8-tick masher still earned the perfect blur in 54 to 66% of strings. Against a cadence of 7 or 9 he drifts one tick a press, and four presses fit inside the 5-tick window as he walks across it.
- **`steadyPresses` is 6 and `blurBeatHalf` stays 2.** A drift of one tick a press can keep only five presses inside the window, so six shuts out every metronome that isn't on the string's exact cadence. Controls measured 15.6% for the blind masher at any string length, which is inside the 20% band: one string in four has his cadence, and five phases in eight are close enough.
- **The cadence set stays 7, 8, 9 and 10.** Changing it would only guard against one metronome's period, and six presses guards against all of them.
- **Tightening to 1 tick is rejected.** It is more than a person can hold.
- **The perfect blur now starts at the sixth on-beat press.** A pattern is five lights and it loops, so the perfect blur is the pattern's second pass. A steady player is rewarded for staying in it, which suits the blur as the long style.
- **The on-contact script** still clears its band: at least 80% of strings of 8 presses or more. Shorter strings can't reach six, so QA measures the band on those.
- **No extra tolerance on touch here.** Two more ticks would cover a whole 7-tick beat. If touch needs help, it gets the slower cadences only.

**Second amendment: back to four presses** (Encounter's slice 11, measured in live play). The six-press ruling above is withdrawn. It can't happen in the director as built: a string is five blows, with four link presses at most, and the fifth blow is the ender.
- **`steadyPresses` is 4 and `blurBeatHalf` is 2,** as first ruled. The lock arrives at the fourth blow.
- **The band is met where it counts.** In live play the blind 8-tick masher locks 13 of 78 strings, which is 17%, inside the 20% band. The contact script locks 72 of 73, and a press 4 ticks late never locks. Controls' 54 to 66% was a synthetic test. In a real match the blows land a cadence plus 4 to 5 ticks of hit-stop apart, so the metronome's drift is different.
- **QA measures this band in live matches,** not on a synthetic press stream.
- **Blur strings don't loop.** A second pass would need the director to run longer strings, which lengthens matches and helps the masher, for no gain now that four presses hold the band.
- **So the perfect blur is the last blow and the ender:** from the fourth on-beat press, the fourth strike lands clean at ×1.0 and the fifth is the full ender, with the full knock-back and a full set-up. The table above reads "fourth" again.
- **If a later change breaks the band** (hit-stop is the thing to watch), the lever is the cadence set, since the press count can't go above four.

**Measured under the final test** (Encounter, 100 live matches each against the medium AI): the blind 8-tick masher locks 13.4% of five-blow strings, against a band of at most 20%, and the contact script locks every string, against at least 80%. Win rates against the medium AI: the masher 50 to 52%, the contact script 67%, and the bolt-only player 39%.

**Two confirmations for the flow.**
1. **A press with no blow to time against leaves the flow as it is.** The press that starts an exchange can't be on or off the beat, so it neither adds to the flow nor resets it. Flow carries from one string to the next, which is how flow 5 and the showcase ender are reached: a string gives at most four timed link presses.
2. **A heavy after one landed strike is the string's ender.** "A string of two or more landed strikes" counts the heavy itself. So with at least one strike landed before it, the heavy is the ender: it launches at flow 3 or more, and otherwise knocks back. A heavy with nothing landed before it is its own exchange, and it keeps the stick earner (§18).

**The numbers.**

| File | Key | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `data/input/timing.json` | `steadyPresses` | 4 |
| | `blurBeatHalf` | 2 ticks |
| | The combo's timed press | Within 4 ticks of a blow landing |
| | The power release | Within 6 ticks of the flash |
| `data/director/alchemy.json` | Flow gained by a timed press | 1, up to 5 |
| | Flow after an off-beat press, or 90 ticks with no press | 0 |
| | Flow after an opening press | Unchanged |
| | Flow for a string's heavy ender to launch | 3 |
| | Flow for the showcase ender | 5 |
| | Landed strikes needed before a heavy for it to be an ender | 1 |
| | The blur's cadence set | 7, 8, 9 and 10 ticks |

**What changes for Controls and Combat.**
- *Controls* (`sim/input/press_read`): "steady" can no longer be decided from the presses alone. It needs the blow contact ticks, as the timed grade already does. A new tolerance, 2 ticks, for the blur's beat, beside the 4 ticks for a combo's timed press.
- *Combat:* every blur string draws a pattern and a cadence (7 to 10 ticks) at its first blow, in place of a fixed spacing.

### 2. Reaching the power style

**The gap:** power needs four or five heavies among the last five presses. Heavy exchanges start about 47 ticks apart, and each press expires 90 ticks after it was made, so no more than three heavies are ever alive. Honest play can't reach it.

**Two changes.**

1. **The window lapses as a whole, not press by press.** Encounter's proposal is confirmed: the last five presses stay until 90 ticks pass with no press, and then the window clears. The flow count already works this way.
2. **With fewer than five presses in the window, the style goes by the share of heavies:**

| Share of heavies in the window | Style |
| :--- | :--- |
| None | Blur |
| Up to 60% | Combo |
| Over 60% | Power |

With five presses this is the rule in §2 unchanged (none; one to three; four or five). With fewer, it means a lone heavy is a power blow, and two heavies running are power. So a player who wants power gets it from his first heavy and doesn't have to press through three exchanges of something else to reach it.

**What changes for Controls** (`sim/input/press_read`): `expireTicks` 90 becomes an idle lapse for the whole window, counted from the last press. `mixShort` stays 5. The style is read from the share of heavies among the presses present.

## 21. The barrage counts every clean shot (2026-10-03)

**What QA found.** A blaster firing light, light, tapped heavy at about 24 ticks a press never finishes a match against a melee player: 40 of 40 reach the 900 s cap. Encounter traced it. After the brink the melee fighter takes about 1,100 bolts and 550 tapped charged shots a match, all clean. But the barrage's ender needs 4 clean **bolts** inside 90 ticks, and this mix fits 3 at most, because every third shot is a charged one. A tapped charged shot doesn't knock back either: that needs a full charge. So nothing decisive ever happens, and damage alone doesn't end a match. A real player firing that mix would stall the same way.

**The ruling: the count is by clean hits of any shot kind, and the window is a little wider.**

| Key (`interrupts.json`, `blast.barrage`) | Value | Was |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| What counts | **A clean hit from any kind of shot,** one for each shot, and one for a whole group (a volley, a split, a rain) | Bolts only |
| `window` | **120 ticks** | 90 |
| `enderAfter` | 4 | Unchanged |
| `immune` | 90 ticks | Unchanged |
| `enderDist` | 1.0 when all four were measured, 0.6 when any was spammed | Unchanged |

- **Why any kind.** The barrage's ender exists so that sustained clean fire can close a fight. That shouldn't depend on which button the fire came from.
- **Why 120.** At about 24 ticks a press, four hits span 72 ticks, which fits. A slower, deliberate shooter at 30 ticks a shot spans exactly 90 and would miss the old window by one tick.
- **It doesn't make bolt spam stronger.** A bolt-only spammer's hits already counted, and he lands four well inside 90 ticks, so neither change gives him anything. The 90 ticks of immunity still cap how often anyone can be knocked back this way.
- **Measured or spammed is unchanged.** If all four shots were fired 10 ticks or more apart with no spread, the ender is the strong one. If any was spammed, it is the weak one, worth half a set-up (§16).
- A full charged shot still knocks back by itself. It also counts as one clean hit.

**What QA checks:**
- E4 and E5 (the light, light, tapped heavy blaster against a melee player): at least 95% of matches finish before the cap;
- the bolt-only player against the medium AI stays at 20 to 40% (30% today);
- blasts stay at 10 to 25% of match damage (11.4% today);
- the mixed blaster's win rate against the medium AI, reported as a new row. The starting band is 25 to 45%;
- brink to KO between AIs stays at 45 to 90 s.

## 22. Making timing worth it, and the mixed blaster (QA's `docs/qa/baseline-df05b9f.md`, 2026-10-03)

### 1. Timing has to give a substantial edge

**What QA found.** A masher who presses on the blur's beat, against a plain masher, locks only 84 of 730 strings, does 9% more damage an exchange, and wins 50.0%. The band is 62 to 82%, and the rules as built can't reach it. In the combo style the edge is invisible too: the timed player reaches flow 3 six times a match against 0.5, but earns 305 launches against 302, because a lone heavy launches without flow (§18).

**Why the reward is small.** It is paid only at the fourth press in a row, which a live exchange rarely allows, and it is paid in damage. Matches are decided by set-ups and finishers, and there the timed masher's enders were as weak as the plain one's.

**The fix pays timing on every press, and pays flow in the things that decide matches.** It uses only what is built: the press grade, the flow count, the enders and the contests.

| # | Rule | Number (for `alchemy.json`) |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **A timed blur press lands clean at once.** Each on-beat blur strike does ×1.0 of a light, against ×0.8 off the beat. It doesn't wait for the lock | `blur.timedMul` 1.0, `blur.strikeMul` 0.8 |
| 2 | **Flow adds damage.** Every strike of his does 4% more for each point of flow, up to 20% at flow 5 | `flow.dmgPer` 0.04 |
| 3 | **The blur's full ender comes from flow.** A blur's ender is the full one (the full knock-back and a full set-up) when his flow is 3 or more as it plays. Below that it is the weak one. This replaces "four presses in a row" as the test for the reward. The four-in-a-row lock stays as the cue for the look | `blur.fullEnderFlow` 3 |
| 4 | **Flow makes a lone heavy's launch bigger.** A lone heavy still launches by the stick with no flow, which keeps Orb's earner. At flow 3, 4 and 5 its launch does 10%, 20% and 30% more impact wear, and at 5 it is the showcase ender | `flow.launchWear` 0.10 per point above 2 |
| 5 | **Flow counts in contests.** Each point of flow adds 2 to his clash score, and takes 2 points off the rival's chance to survive his finisher, up to 10 | `flow.contest` 2 |
| 6 | **The AI times by difficulty.** It presses on the beat on 15%, 45% or 80% of its presses | `ai.timedShare` 0.15, 0.45, 0.8 |

- Flow carries from string to string and falls to 0 on an off-beat press, so a player who keeps time holds these bonuses and one who doesn't never has them.
- Rules 3 and 5 are the ones that move win rate, because they act on set-ups and finishers. Rules 1, 2 and 4 make the edge visible in every exchange.

**What it should do.**

| Measure | Expected | Band |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A timed masher against a plain masher | About 40% more damage a string, and twice the set-ups at the brink | 62 to 82% |
| A timed combo player against the same style untimed | The same bonuses through flow | 62 to 70% |
| Match length | **Shorter,** because the AI now times too and its strikes hit harder. The median should come down from 496 s toward 480 | 6:00 to 8:00, or to 8:30 if Orb agrees (§19) |
| The masher against the medium AI | **Down,** because the medium AI holds some flow and he holds none. It is 50 to 52% today, at the top of the band | 35 to 50% |

QA re-measures all four. If timing overshoots 82%, the first number to lower is `flow.contest`.

### 2. The mixed blaster

**Measured:** the light, light, tapped heavy blaster wins 57.5% against the medium AI at 40 matches (Encounter had 45 of 100, and QA is re-running at 100). Against a melee script that doesn't respond it wins 82 to 88%, which mostly measures the script.

- **The band is 30 to 50%.** It is a fixed pattern with no defence, like the masher, so it should lose slightly more than it wins against the default opponent. The first band of 25 to 45% was set before any reading.
- **If the 100-match row holds near 55%, the number to move is the ender's strength, not the window.** **A barrage that includes a tapped, uncharged heavy shot gets the weak ender:** 0.6 of the distance and half a set-up. Data: `blast.barrage.tappedHeavyWeak` true.
- **Why that one.** The window and the count are what stop the stall, and §21 only just fixed that. The trouble is that a mindless rhythm earns the strong ender, since 24 ticks a press counts as measured. A tapped heavy is the lazy shot in that mix. With the weak ender the mixed blaster still closes a fight, and takes twice as many enders to open the rival, like every other untimed plan.
- Measured bolts alone, and full charged shots, keep the strong results.

## 23. Rulings on slice 13 (Encounter's `docs/director/agency-slice-13.md`, 2026-10-04)

§22 is built. Timing now reaches its band when the script is truly on the beat: the timed masher and the timed combo player each win 65.0%. The masher wins 100%, 38% and 1% against the three difficulties, the bolt-only player 33%, and finisher survival is 31.5%. All are in band.

### 1. The mixed blaster: a tapped heavy shot does less

**Measured:** 61 of 100 against the medium AI, against a band of 30 to 50%. The weak ender is already on for that mix, so the ender isn't what carries it. A tapped charged shot does 49.5 for one press, against a bolt's 13.

- **`blast.heavy.tapShare` goes from 0.6 to 0.4.** A tap then does 33, about two and a half bolts, and the full charge is unchanged at 82.5. The charge is what the heavy button is for, and an uncharged tap shouldn't be worth nearly four bolts.
- The blaster's light, light, tapped heavy cycle falls from 75.5 to 59 damage, about a fifth less.
- **If he is still over 50% at 100 matches, the next step is 0.3,** and not a ki cost or a delay. One number is easier to tune and to explain.
- **What to watch:** blasts' share of match damage is 11.6% and will dip. If it falls under 10%, the AI's firing share goes up a step. The bolt-only player is untouched.

### 2. Flow in the finisher contest gets a floor

**The gap:** a flow-5 attacker takes 10 points off the victim's survival. That is about 15% against an average victim, but 0% against a victim on the struggle's floor of 8%.

**The flow's cut never takes survival below the struggle's own floor, 8%.** A victim always keeps what the struggle guarantees a fighter who presses nothing, and a victim who plays the struggle well keeps more: 35% becomes 25% against flow 5. Only the time-cap event sets survival to 0 (`spec-wounds.md` §2). Data: `flow.contestFloor` 0.08.

### 3. The lights-only mirror's brink

**Measured:** brink to KO fell to 34.7 s from 49.6 s, against the 45 to 55 s that was expected. The likely cause is the struggle ruling: a masher's stray presses now void his hits, so mashing the struggle earns no survival.

**The row is re-based to 30 to 55 s, and nothing else moves.** Two players who mash everything, the struggle included, should fall quickly once on the brink. That is the price of mashing the struggle, and it is the rule working. The band that matters, 45 to 90 s between AIs that defend, is unchanged. What this row guards is that such a fight finishes (at least 95% before the cap) and doesn't end in an instant.

### Recorded: a timed player against the medium AI

A timed player wins 40 of 40 against the medium AI, against a band of 70 to 90%. Raising the timed press, the flow's contest bonus and the flow's damage did not move it. The medium AI starts no finishers and holds no flow for 88% of the match. This isn't a tuning question: it is how hard the default opponent should be, and it is with Orb.

### 4. The slow, deliberate shooter (added after slice 14)

**Measured on slice 14:** the mixed blaster is at 46 of 100 against the medium AI, inside 30 to 50%. Bolt-only is at 31%, blasts are 10.8% of damage, finisher survival is 27.0%, the median is 477 s and the masher is at 38%. One row moved the wrong way: the slow mix (light, light, tapped heavy, one press every 24 ticks) fell from 29 to 7 of 100.

**7% is too low, and the fix is the rule about which barrages are weak.** A pattern that never defends should lose to the default opponent, but a player who fires slowly and deliberately is doing what the measured-fire rule rewards everywhere else. Today every barrage with a tapped heavy in it is weak, however carefully it was fired.

- **A tapped heavy makes the barrage weak only when it was rushed:** fired less than **20 ticks** after the shot before it. Fired 20 ticks or more after, it counts as measured, and the barrage's ender is the strong one if the bolts were measured too. Data: `blast.barrage.tappedHeavyGap` 20.
- This is the bolt rule again, with a longer gap for the heavier shot: measured fire closes strong, and rushed fire closes weak.
- `tapShare` stays at 0.4. Raising it would bring the fast mix back over its band.
- **Bands:** the slow mix against the medium AI at **15 to 35%.** Against the easy AI at least 50%, since slow, careful firing is how a beginner plays. The fast mix stays at 30 to 50%, and QA re-checks it, because it must still read as rushed.

## 24. Re-banding the timing and energy rows (QA's `docs/qa/baseline-9da6e07.md`, 2026-10-04)

With QA's scripts fixed, timing reads as intended: a timed masher beats a plain one 75.0% of the time, with the stick and without it, and a timed player beats a masher 75.0%. The rows below were banded before §22, or were measured at 40 matches, where one row moves about 15 points by chance.

**A rule for these rows first.** The T rows use the stick and the F rows don't. At 40 matches each, a band narrower than 20 points can't be judged. So each pair is **pooled** (80 matches), and no number moves on a row until QA has it at 100 matches or more.

| Row | Measured | Old band | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T1 and F1,** timed against a masher | 75.0% and 85.0%, pooled 80.0% | 72 to 82 | **The band moves to 72 to 85%.** Pooled it is in. §22 made timing stronger, so the top needs a little room |
| **T2 and F2,** timed against style-only | 57.5% and 80.0%, pooled 68.8% | 62 to 70 | **The band moves to 60 to 75%, pooled.** Pooled it is in. The two halves differ because the stick gives the style-only player launches from lone heavies, which is the earner Orb kept |
| **T3 and F3,** style-only against a masher | 67.5% and 50.0%, pooled 58.8% | 55 to 62 | **The band moves to 55 to 68%, pooled.** Pooled it is in. With the stick a style-only player launches and a masher doesn't |
| **T4, T5, F4 and F5,** the mirrors | 47.5% to 62.5% | 45 to 55 | **The band stays, and the rows are only reported at 40 matches.** The same script is on both sides, so anything outside the band there is chance. QA gates them at 200 matches |
| **T7,** a timed hold against a plain hold | 32.5% | 62 to 82 | **Pending.** The power style's timed upgrade isn't built |
| **T8,** timed against the medium AI | 95.0% | 70 to 90 | **Recorded.** It is with Orb, as the question of how hard the default opponent should be |
| **T10,** timed against the hard AI | 35.0% | 40 to 60 | **The band stays.** QA re-runs it at 100. If it is still under 40%, the hard AI's `ai.timedShare` goes from 0.8 to 0.7. A skilled player should win about half against the hard AI |
| **E5 and E5s,** the blaster against the rush-heavy timed script | 40 of 40 | 40 to 60 | **The band applies only to an opponent who answers** (below) |
| **The slow mix** against the medium AI | 13% | None | **15 to 35%,** with the change in §23, part 4: a tapped heavy weakens the barrage only when it is rushed (`blast.barrage.tappedHeavyGap` 20). Against the easy AI, at least 50% |

**The blaster against a rusher: the band is for a defending opponent.** The 40 to 60% band asks whether keeping a rival away with blasts is fair against closing in. It only means something when the rusher uses the answers the rules give him:
- a held heavy charge from the far band, which shrugs off bolts;
- a guard on the way in;
- a perfect block for the free approach.

QA's rush script does none of them, so 40 of 40 measures the script. **QA builds a rush script that answers, and the 40 to 60% band applies to that.** Until then the row is reported, and the gates for ranged play are the ones against the medium AI, which does answer: the mixed blaster at 30 to 50% (49% today) and the bolt-only player at 20 to 40% (31%).

**QA's measured list** (wear 350, the act-4 mood floor at 3400, and the perfect-block multipliers at 0.32, 0.45 and 0.55) is accepted. It brings the median to about 469 s and all three perfect-block rows into band. The masher against the medium AI rises to 49% under it, at the top of his band, so that row is the one to watch.

## 25. Rulings from questionnaire 15 and Orb's match against the AI (2026-10-04)

Orb's answers and notes are in `docs/ep/vision.md` (last section). Every number is a starting value.

### 1. Downtime: the fight shouldn't keep stopping

**Orb:** "they will trade around three to five blows, the AI will slip away in some kind of looping pattern, then I'll catch up to him, and repeat."

**The cause.** In reach, an attacking AI circles its rival on an ellipse until its next attack beat, a full turn in about 2.6 s. After a knock-back it does the same from further off. So each exchange is followed by a loop, and the player has to chase.

**The rule: after every exchange somebody presses, and soon.**

| After the exchange ends in | Who acts | Within |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A stay** (both still in reach) | The AI attacks again, or holds guard in reach | 20, 30 or 45 ticks (hard, medium, easy) |
| **A knock-back** | The AI that won it follows with a lunge or a blast. The one knocked back guards or lunges back when he is up | 30 ticks after the slide ends |
| **A launch** | The launcher follows: a charge, a ping-pong or a blast | 120 ticks after the landing |

- **The weave is capped at 30 ticks.** The AI may still circle for half a second, as flavour. It can't loop for a full turn.
- **A cap on slipping away.** Moving out of reach without attacking is a slip. The AI may slip **once in a row** and **three times a minute.** After a slip its next action is an attack, a blast, or a guard in reach.
- **No new reason to stay in is needed for the player.** His flow already lapses after 90 ticks without a press, so backing off costs him his timing bonuses. The fault was the AI's.

**Data** (`ai.json`): `reengageTicks` 20, 30 and 45; `knockbackFollowTicks` 30; `launchFollowTicks` 120; `weaveMaxTicks` 30; `maxSlipsRow` 1; `maxSlipsPerMin` 3.

**The QA rows:**

| Row | Band |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Idle seconds a minute:** time with both fighters free and neither striking, firing, charging, guarding a blow or taunting. Pauses and launch flights don't count | **At most 8 s a minute** |
| Release to the next request, 90th percentile | At most 2.0 s. The median stays at most 1.0 s |
| AI slips in a row | Never more than 1 (a hard test) |

**The launch share goes with it.** Launches are 38.5 to 40.6% of the exchanges that separate the fighters, at or over the top of the 25 to 40% band and well above Orb's 30. The AI's use of the launch earners comes down: medium from 0.6 to **0.5** and hard from 1.0 to **0.85.** Fewer launches also means fewer separations to recover from. The band stays 25 to 40%.

### 2. Launches and charges the eye can follow

**Orb:** "the speed and acceleration of launches can be tuned to accommodate the viewer", and a rival flying in from far away at top speed "is very hard to judge".

**A launch keeps its path and its landing point. Only its timing along the path changes.**

| Key | Value | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `launch.easeTicks` | 8 | He covers the first part of the path slowly, so the eye catches which way he went |
| `launch.easeShare` | 0.15 | That first part is 15% of the path |
| `launch.topSpeed` | 150 units a tick to start. Camera sets it from what it can hold | Speed along the path never goes above it |
| `launch.maxAddTicks` | 12 | The flight may take at most this much longer. Past that the camera cuts, by its existing rule |

**The same cap applies to a charge from the far band,** and a charge gets two cues so the defender can judge it:
- at its start, a flash on the charger and a streak along his line, for 12 ticks;
- 20 ticks before contact, a marker on the defender.

A held light charge can also be steered a little, up to 15 degrees by the stick. A held heavy stays a straight line.

### 3. Buildings: less levelled, more damaged

**Orb chose the hybrid:** cut the top tiers' reach into buildings, soften landing blasts, and "pavement should crack and shatter differently from dirt, can windows shatter + multiple levels of dynamic destruction per building".

**World's starting split:**

| Lever | Today | Start from |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Structure reach at tier 3 | ×1.6 | ×1.6 |
| Structure reach at tier 4 | ×2.8 | **×2.0** |
| `area.slam` (a landing's blast on structures) | 0.9 | **0.6** |

**Target:** front-row structures lost at the KO of 40 to 48%, inside the 25 to 50% band. QA measured 45.9% with the reach change alone.

**Staged damage.** A building has five stages, moved by the share of its hp it has lost.

| Stage | Hp lost | What it looks like |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Under 25% | Intact, with scorch marks |
| 1 | 25% | **Windows out:** the glass is gone and the frames are scorched |
| 2 | 50% | **A floor or a corner gone** |
| 3 | 75% | **A shell:** walls standing, with the roof and floors gone |
| 4 | 100% | **Rubble** |

- **One hit moves a building at most two stages,** or three at tier 4. So no single blast takes an intact tower to rubble. The exceptions are a body going through it (a brunt) and a beam inside its per-tier cap.
- **The outer part of a big impact's reach only breaks windows.** Past the base radius, in the extra reach that tiers 3 and 4 add, damage stops at stage 2. That is the windows blowing out for blocks that Orb picked, and it cuts front-row losses without shrinking the blast.
- **Only rubble counts as lost** for the structure bands and the ceiling. QA also reports buildings at stage 2 or worse as "damaged", with a starting band of 55 to 80% of the front row by the KO.
- **People leave at stage 2.** They are counted under the collateral window as before, so a shell or a heap of rubble is empty.

**Pavement against dirt** (World and VFX):

| | Dirt, sand, soil | Paving |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A crater | A bowl with a raised rim and thrown earth | **Plates:** shallower (×0.7 of the depth), with slabs tilted up at the rim and cracks running out to 1.5 times the crater's radius |
| A skid | A furrow | A line of shattered slabs |
| Afterwards | Stays dirt | Counts as soil for braking, as already ruled (`balance-targets.md` §20) |

### 4. Blast kinds in this update

**Only the rival's splitting shot ships.** Rain and the curving shot are dropped from this update, and their rules stay written for later (`launch-pair-plan.md` §9).
- **The split's numbers stand alone.** Each kind was written as its own block, and nothing in the split's rows depends on the other two.
- The Protagonist has no extra kind in this update. His slower spread build-up is his energy identity for now.
- For when rain returns: **Orb's answer is that it does not hit its thrower,** which replaces that row in §9.
- **A deflected shot's landing is a surprise:** no ring marks where it will come down.

### 5. The finisher struggle

**Strictness 2 of 3 is confirmed** as Combat's softer option: each stray press costs 0.10 (`perStray` −0.10), and the floor at the no-press score is kept. A masher loses his struggle, and a player with one or two nervous presses doesn't.

### 6. Unchanged

Orb didn't answer how hard the medium AI should be against a timed player, or the fighters' names. Both stay as they are: the timed player's 95% against medium is recorded (§24), and the build keeps its working ids.

### The earlier rows, finished in this pass

- **The slow mix** (11 to 13% against medium): §23, part 4 stands. A tapped heavy weakens a barrage only when it was rushed (`tappedHeavyGap` 20). Band 15 to 35%.
- **The timing bands** T1 to T3, F1 to F3 and T10: §24 stands.
- **A script that doesn't defend:** the 40 to 60% blaster band applies only to an opponent who answers (§24).
