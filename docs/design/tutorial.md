# Tutorial: the How-to-play card and a guided first match

Owner: Game Design. Status: plan, for UI, Encounter, Simulation, Narrative and QA. Date: 2026-09-30.

Orb's onboarding choice (questionnaire 4) is a How-to-play card plus a guided first match. It answers Orb's friend: "I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do… a tutorial or a card explaining how to play would be good." This plan builds on UI's proposal (`docs/ui/tutorial-proposal.md`), reworked for Orb's control ruling (`stance-matrix.md` §4b).

**The principle, front and centre.** The player owns strategy, pacing and positioning. The director owns combos, tactics, timing and voice. So the tutorial teaches **choices and reads, never timing**. There are no parry presses and no struggle presses, because both are director outcomes now.

## The beats (one match, about 4 to 5 minutes, on the real planet)

No fail state, no fixed timer and no forced order: a beat done early is ticked off. Hints reappear only after 20 s without the action. Skip is always one key.

| # | The player learns to… | The beat is done when | The hint line (Narrative writes the final text) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Fly, and that the planet wraps | They fly to the rival, or across the seam | "Fly. The world wraps: keep going and you come back round." |
| 2 | Attack, hold Guard or tap Dodge, and see the blows follow | They attack, hold Guard and tap Dodge at least once each, and watch an exchange in each | "Attack, hold Guard, or tap Dodge. The blows follow." |
| 3 | Choose the attack's weight to beat what the rival is doing | They press heavy while the rival holds Guard, and see a GUARD BREAK | "They're guarding. Hit heavy." |
| 4 | Read damage on bodies | A rival region reaches battered, with the wound card and the crown arc | "Watch the body: that's how you read damage." |
| 5 | Read the rival's wind-up and answer it | They tap Dodge into a heavy, or hold Guard against lights and then land a perfect block or a reversal | "A heavy is winding up. Tap Dodge, or hold Guard and wait." |
| 6 | Charge, and fire a signature | They hold Power to charge to 45 ki, then fire the signature | "Charge, then call your signature." |
| 7 | Take a transformation when it's ready | The form becomes ready and they hold both triggers to take it | "You're ready. Transform when you choose." |
| 8 | Meet a finisher with the right answer | The rival's finisher telegraphs its kind, and they answer it (hold Guard against a launch, tap Dodge against a melee finisher, or press Signature with 40 ki against a beam; `melee-press-feel.md` §11), then see the struggle's pulses hold | "They're going for the finish. Brace, slip or meet it." |
| 9 | Be let go | A normal match against an easy rival | "From here, the fight is yours." |

The stance keys went with ADR 0008, so every beat uses the held states: attack, hold Guard, tap Dodge. The hint lines are Narrative's corrected ones (`docs/narrative/rule-of-cool-narrative.md`).

Beats 3, 5 and 8 are the read lessons: the attack's weight against what the rival is doing, and the right answer to the finisher's kind. They are the game's real skill, taught by doing.

## What each director builds (through the EP)

- **Encounter and Simulation: a tutorial rival profile, in data.**
  - A slow cadence, and it holds each state (attacking, guarding, dodging) for at least 3 s so the read is possible.
  - It always telegraphs weight and finisher kind.
  - It steers into beats 3, 5 and 8 when they haven't happened yet.
  - It stops at the brink for beat 8, and never finishes the player.
  - No rule changes: only a profile.
- **Narrative:** the hint lines (short, no jargon, no franchise terms), plus a few inner thoughts that model the reads ("They're guarding. Something heavy, then.").
- **UI:** the card (built), the hint line, beat ticks, and a menu entry.
- **Events** (UI's spec): `tutorial_beat {id, state}` with start, done or skipped, and `tutorial_hint {id, text_key}`. The beat script is a data file that reads existing events: the held state changing, `exchange_start`, the template tag, `region_stage`, charge, `heat_stage` or the form fill, `finisher_start` and `finisher_contest`.
- **Accessibility:** hints are text plus an icon, there is a "keep hints on" toggle, and reduced motion is respected.
- **QA:** a bot playthrough that ticks every beat.

## How we know it worked

A playtest with people new to the game, one session each, with no help:
- time to the first deliberate Guard or Dodge: under 60 s;
- 80% can say afterwards what heavy does to a guarding rival;
- 80% can say where they read the rival's damage;
- 70% pick the right answer to a telegraphed finisher on their own, in the hand-off match;
- the share who quit before the first finisher: tracked;
- the test sentence: nobody says "I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do".

The tutorial match does not count toward UI's "first three matches with prompts". Prompts stay on for the three matches after it.
