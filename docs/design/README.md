# Design docs

Owner: Game Design. These pages define what the game is and why it is fun, and every other director builds on them. Start with Orb's vision (`docs/ep/vision.md`), then the pillars.

| Page | What it answers |
| :--- | :--- |
| [pillars.md](pillars.md) | The seven pillars: what each means in play, how we test it, what breaks it, and where the prototype stands |
| [stance-matrix.md](stance-matrix.md) | What each stance is for, what beats it and what it costs. Intended outcomes per pairing, P2 gaps, dominance risks, and the P2 stance rules |
| [economy.md](economy.md) | HP, ki, tiers and transformations, ego meters, hiding and ambush, collateral scaling, and how a 5-to-7-minute match escalates |
| [balance-targets.md](balance-targets.md) | The bands QA checks: win rate, length, escalation, collateral, variety, stance balance, story beats. Also the prototype's balance-gap diagnosis |
| [living-destruction-numbers.md](living-destruction-numbers.md) | Numbers for fire, smoke and dust cover, landslides, quakes, rifts and lava: tier ladders, rates, hazard wear, frequencies, and the readability and collateral rules |
| [moveset-rules.md](moveset-rules.md) | Specials, signatures, world-changing abilities, hidden weapons, one transformation mechanic per fighter, and style shifts (questionnaire 6) |
| [launch-pair-plan.md](launch-pair-plan.md) | The next big update's two fighters, the Protagonist and the rival, by owner: identity in play, stats and forms, moveset needs, energy kinds, what changes, what Orb supplies, and the order |
| [melee-press-feel.md](melee-press-feel.md) | The close brawl after Orb's approved prototype: every press is a blow, magnetism, mash, skill strikes on the beat, the heavy as guard breaker and juggle starter, block, both attacking at once, what stays the director's, QA bands, the approach (lunges, charges, the pursuit, and the manoeuvre stance's zips), the five stances by button with B as each stance's signature and three hybrids reserved, the three readings (speed, tech, heavy) of X, Y and B in every stance, A's press and hold with the grab lockout, the counters to a zip, the signatures in three tiers and the rule for what starts a struggle, stance transitions and tells, the rules a generated moveset must obey with the forms' numbers, and Orb's answers to its ten questions (questionnaire 17) |
| [roster-twelve.md](roster-twelve.md) | The mechanical half of the roster of twelve, lined up with Narrative's identity half and with Orb's answers in questionnaire 18: eight axes for describing a fighter in this game, the first four classified with their roles and subroles and the gaps they leave, nine templates paired with Narrative's identities (four certain: speedster, stalker, armoured heavy, shaper; five for four open slots: grappler, zoner, puppeteer, wildcard, juggernaut), four alternatives kept, three sets for a hero-heavy cast, the build order on a zero budget, what Orb is still asked to choose, and one table of the twelve |
| [agency-pass.md](agency-pass.md) | Options from Orb's first two-player playtest: the ranged attack lockout, the fight alchemist, brawls against launches, air recovery, energy play, flight on the left trigger, and hard impacts. The rules from Orb's first two-player playtest: three range bands, the fight alchemist and its flow count, Blow for Blow, the four launch earners, hold to brake, the first energy slice, the provisional boost and escape, burying impacts, what each tier reads as, and the build order |
| [control-rules.md](control-rules.md) | The game rules for the ADR 0008 control scheme: the perfect block, dodge-cancel and burst, the power layer and the transform hold, the context button, the Simple layout, mashing, and the placeholder transform |
| [rule-of-cool.md](rule-of-cool.md) | Orb's rule-of-cool picks as a rationed feature list: trigger, tier gate, frequency, cost, owners and build order, plus the pulse rule for clashes and the three answers to a beam |
| [upgrade-plan.md](upgrade-plan.md) | The pre-match upgrade draft Orb picked: three shared rounds of pick-one-of-three, switching on act by act, with the pool, limits and screen flow |
| [unlocks.md](unlocks.md) | Cosmetics earned through play: what earns them, pacing, the local save and later online, and why cosmetics never touch balance |
| [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) | The How-to-play card and the guided first match: beats that teach reads, never timing |
| [modes.md](modes.md) | Modes with stable ids, the 1.0 scope, and the rules for each mode |
| [damage-model.md](damage-model.md) | No health bars: body-region wear, brink and finisher, how each fighter takes damage, and how the player reads it |
| [spec-wounds.md](spec-wounds.md) | **The binding Wounds spec**: rules, Rally, the per-fighter damage profile and readout, sim data, and acceptance tests. Input for Combat and Encounter Systems |
| [pitches.md](pitches.md) | Pitches for Orb: the wear readout, a Rally per fighter, downtime ideas, fragments under Legal's conditions, broken limbs, and the in-match upgrade draft |
| [systems-sketch.md](systems-sketch.md) | Transformations, minions, fusion (deferred; Tandem), keystone relocation, civilian consumption, procedural planets |
| [future-stealth-fighter.md](future-stealth-fighter.md) | The hiding kit as it was (recovery, ambush, found and searching, the hunter's view), kept for a future stealth fighter |
| [open-questions.md](open-questions.md) | The questions for Orb, with options and recommendations, and the decisions Game Design made |
| [prototype-bugs.md](prototype-bugs.md) | Prototype defects that matter to design, with the intent each one breaks. They are not fixed until the port proves parity |

**Conventions**
- **Code.** `index.html:L123` is a line of `prototype/index.html` at commit `7233c96`.
- **QA.** "QA §n" is a section of `qa/baseline-p0.md`.
- **Names.**
  - Stances are AGGRESSIVE, DEFENSIVE, EVASIVE and ESCAPE. CHARGING is a state, not a stance.
  - Attack kinds are light, heavy and signature.
  - "Ki" is the internal name for the energy resource (Legal RL-015).
- **Placeholders.** The prototype's KAI and VORR stand in for Orb's four fighters. KAI will not ship (Legal RL-002).
- **Pending picks.** Signature replacements follow Legal's first option, marked "pending Orb's pick" (`docs/legal/fighter-concepts-review.md`).
