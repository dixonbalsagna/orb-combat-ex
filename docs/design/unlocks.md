# Unlocks: cosmetics earned through play

Owner: Game Design. Orb wants a vast assortment of cosmetics across the four fighters, unlocked through play (`docs/ep/vision.md`, "Moveset scope and cosmetics"). Art owns the categories and the items (`docs/art/cosmetics-plan.md`). This page owns the unlock tracks, the pacing and the save.

## 1. The rules

1. **Only cosmetics unlock.** Everything that changes play is open from the start (Orb, questionnaire 3): fighters, modes, planets, specials, signatures, world-change picks and transformations. When a moveset grows by data, the new moves reach everyone at once. The first fighter's moveset is no longer the Lean one: it starts at 8 specials, 8 signatures and 16 showcases (`docs/combat/m0-rich.md`).
2. **Earned through play only.**
   - There are no purchases, loot boxes, paid currency or random reward rolls.
   - Every item has a named condition the player can see, except a few secrets, which show a hint.
   - Art's `rarity` field is display only: it says how showy an item is, never its odds.
   - Paid items would need a new decision from Orb and a Legal review.
3. **Nothing is missable.** Challenges never expire, and no item is ever withdrawn.
4. **Cosmetics never touch balance** (§5).

## 2. What earns unlocks

| Source | How it works |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Play** | Every finished match in Versus, Versus CPU, Arcade, Survival or Team Battle gives mastery points to the fighter used (§3). A losing player still progresses. Training and replays give nothing |
| **The run** (`run-mode.md` §4.4) | Every fight won in a run gives half again a match's mastery points and a keepsake. The run's end pays a haul: points by fights won and styles, the feats met, and on a won run a pick of three items. Each final arc's first clear is a showpiece, styles in a run give items and titles, and challenge tiers give borders and aura tints. The seed of the day gives a weekly item |
| **Per-fighter mastery** | 60 levels per fighter, and each level gives one item from that fighter's pool. Every 5th level offers a choice of 3, so players steer toward what they want without a currency. The two items not picked stay in the pool for later levels. Levels 10, 30 and 60 give a showpiece: an outfit set, a victory pose or a scene |
| **Milestones** | Per fighter: the first win, the Arcade clear (a showpiece), and 25 and 100 matches. Account-wide: 10, 50, 100, 250 and 500 matches; the first Team Battle win; every mode played; every fighter's Arcade clear; and one per biome class |
| **Style labels** | Finishing a match with a style label (turtle, rusher, runner, charger, sniper or mixer; `docs/narrative/style-thresholds.md`) counts toward that label for that fighter. 3 finishes unlock an item and 10 unlock a title. All six labels on one fighter is a showpiece. It rewards trying every way to play |
| **Set pieces (feats)** | First-time moments, per fighter (list below) |
| **Challenges** | Three challenges are open at a time, drawn from one fixed, seeded sequence, so they are the same for everyone and work offline. Finishing one opens the next, and a skipped challenge goes to the back of the sequence. Examples: win at tier 1 only; win as the Protagonist with under 10% casualties; land 3 signatures in one match. Authored challenges join with the `scenarios` mode after 1.0 |
| **Secrets** | A few, each with a hint: for example, win without entering DEFENSIVE, or win a beam struggle at tier 1 |

**The feats**, 24 per fighter:
- the first crippling moment dealt;
- a win while crippled;
- each world change used (8 per fighter, `moveset-rules.md` §9);
- up to 4 form stages reached, where the final stage is a showpiece: the Empress's Final Approved, the Protagonist's Open Hand, the Anti-hero's Apex, the Cyborg going Online;
- a won beam struggle;
- a Rally;
- a comeback win;
- a full 5-link chain;
- a time-cap ending;
- **the signature log:** 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of that fighter's signature variants seen, by biome, altitude and stance. This rewards pillar 7. The thresholds are shares, so they scale as movesets grow.

**What goals never ask for:**
- civilian casualties. Pillar 5 is personality, not a scoreboard. Protecting goals are fine;
- losing on purpose, quitting, or anything that spoils the match for the other player;
- the hardest AI difficulty, except for one showpiece per fighter;
- online play. Every item can be earned offline.

## 3. The curve, fitted to Art's pool

**The pool, deduplicated.** Art plans about 160 items per fighter. Patterns (10), trails (10), beam tints (12) and victory scenes (6) are shared across the fighters, so:
- each fighter has **122 items of its own**;
- **38 items are shared**;
- the total is **526 items**: 4 × 122 + 38.

UI's roughly 40 titles, frames and nameplates come on top.

**Where the items come from:**

| Track | Per fighter (122) | Shared (38) | Total | Share |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Mastery | 60 | 0 | 240 | 46% |
| Challenges | 25 | 20 | 120 | 23% |
| Feats | 24 | 0 | 96 | 18% |
| Milestones | 4 | 14 | 30 | 6% |
| Style labels (3 finishes, and all six) | 7 | 0 | 28 | 5% |
| Secrets | 2 | 4 | 12 | 2% |

- The shared milestones assume 6 biome classes. The challenge count absorbs any difference.
- UI's marks go to the 24 style-label titles (10 finishes), one mastery-60 nameplate per fighter, and 12 frames on the account milestones.

**The mastery curve.**
- *Points:* a finished match gives 12 points per minute played (up to 12 minutes), plus up to 15 for events (exchanges won, chains, clashes). A win adds 15%. So a typical 7-minute match gives about 95 points for a loss and 110 for a win.
- *Cost:* level n costs 100 + 15 × (n − 1) points, capped at 535 from level 30 on.
- *Total:* levels 1 to 30 cost 9,525 points and levels 31 to 60 cost 16,050, so 25,575 in all. That is about 250 matches, or about 36 hours at about 7 matches an hour with menus.

**The pace, checked:**

| Stage | Pace |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Match 1** | An item: mastery level 1 costs 100 points |
| **First 10 hours** (about 70 matches) | About 50 to 65 items, about 10% of the pool. Mastery reaches about level 25 on the fighter played, and early feats, milestones and challenges land. It starts at about one item a match and eases to one every two |
| **10 to 100 hours** | One item every 2 to 3 matches when rotating fighters (their early levels are cheap), or every 3 to 4 when sticking to one. About 75% of the collection is owned by 100 hours |
| **The long tail** | Mastery 60 on one fighter comes at about 36 hours, which finishes most of that fighter's pool. 100% takes about 150 hours (about 1,050 matches), set by mastery 60 on every fighter (four today) |

- **Tuning.** The points, costs and allocation are data (`data/unlocks/`). QA checks the pace table from AI-vs-AI batches using the same event log. The target bands are: first item in match 1; 40 to 70 items by 10 hours; 60 to 85% by 100 hours; one fighter's mastery in 30 to 40 hours; 100% in 150 to 200 hours at four fighters (§3b).
- **Growth.** New items from updates slot into the existing tracks: mastery levels past 60, new feats, new challenges, and a signature log that grows as movesets grow. Returning players always have something new to earn.
- **No duplicates.** A reward is never an item the player already owns.

### 3b. Re-fitting for another roster size

Nothing in the tracks names a fighter count. The rules are data, and the allocation is computed from Art's item list.

**The inputs:**
- `N`, the number of fighters (4 today);
- `F`, the items per fighter (122);
- `S`, the shared items (38);
- each fighter's feat count, which comes from their content (24 today: 7 fixed moments, 8 world changes, up to 4 form stages and 5 signature-log thresholds).

**The rules:**
1. **Per fighter:**
   - mastery levels are about half of `F` (60 of 122);
   - the feats are whatever that fighter's content gives;
   - there are 4 milestones, 7 style-label items and 2 secrets;
   - challenges take the rest.
2. **Shared:** the milestones and secrets above; shared challenges take the rest. Roster-wide milestones say "every fighter", never a number.
3. **Level costs:** the curve keeps its shape, with the cost rising up to half the levels and then flat. One factor scales it so a fighter's mastery takes 30 to 40 hours, which is about 25,000 points at about 100 points a match and 7 matches an hour.
4. **The fixed target is per fighter:** one fighter's pool is mostly done in 30 to 40 hours. The full collection takes about `N` × 36 hours, so the 150 to 200 hour band holds only for 4 or 5 fighters. With a bigger roster the full collection simply takes longer, and no player needs every fighter at max mastery.

At Art's current sizes:

| Fighters | Items | Full collection |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4 | 526 | About 150 hours |
| 6 | 770 | About 220 hours |
| 8 | 1,014 | About 290 hours |

## 4. The save: offline now, online later

- **A local profile.** One versioned JSON file in Godot's `user://`, holding:
  - the owned item ids;
  - goal counters, mastery points and the challenge position;
  - the equipped cosmetics;
  - the schema version.

  It is written atomically, with one backup copy.
- **Stable ids.** Each item's track sits in Art's loadout data (`data/art/cosmetics/`), and the goals and the curve sit in `data/unlocks/`. Both use stable string ids that are never reused, with schemas in `tools/schemas/`. A removed item stays owned, and an unknown id is kept and ignored, so old saves always load.
- **Outside the sim.** The meta layer checks unlocks after the match, from the match's event log. The sim never reads the profile, and replays never award anything, so determinism and replays are untouched.
- **Portability.** The profile can be exported and imported as a file. This matters most in the browser, where storage can be wiped, and for moving between devices.
- **Online, later.**
  - The local profile stays the source of truth. Cosmetics can't change balance, so there is nothing to cheat and no server check is needed.
  - In a lobby, each side sends its equipped cosmetic ids. An item the other player's build lacks shows as the default.
  - Account sync can come later as a convenience, not a requirement.
- **Unlock all cosmetics** (Orb: yes, 2026-09-30). This is a plain setting, off by default. Anyone can edit their save in an open-source game, and this is the honest version of that.
  - It makes every item equippable, but it doesn't mark anything as earned. Progress keeps counting underneath, so switching the setting off returns the player's earned collection exactly.
  - The collection screen marks items the player earned, so the earned collection stays meaningful.
  - It changes nothing else: cosmetics can't touch balance, and online opponents see equipped items as usual.
- **Player-made palettes** (Orb: later).
  - Players build a palette in an editor. Art's palette validator checks it against the lane rules and every readability lock in §5.
  - A player-made palette is stored in the profile as data. It is a tool, not a reward: it is open from the start when it lands, and it doesn't count toward the collection.
  - Online, it travels as palette data in the lobby. The receiving side validates it again and shows the default if it fails, or if that player has chosen to show opponents in default cosmetics.

## 5. Cosmetics never touch balance

- **The sim never reads cosmetic data.** A cosmetic has no stats, hurtboxes, size, speed, timing or AI behaviour. Cosmetics live only in the render and UI layers.
- **Readability locks.** A cosmetic can't hide, recolour or replace:
  - the wound readout on the body, or the brink call-out (`spec-wounds.md` §3);
  - transformation tells: the Empress's revision tells and number, the Protagonist's heat seams and steam, the Anti-hero's regalia, the Cyborg's form stages;
  - telegraphs: signature wind-ups, parry and chain cues, hazard warnings, and the info flashes (`docs/art/cosmetics-plan.md`);
  - the silhouette, beyond Art's envelope.
- **Colour rules.** Each fighter stays distinct from every biome and from the rival. If both sides pick near-identical colours or auras, the second side shifts automatically, so beam struggles stay readable. Team colours stay locked in Team Battle.
- **Sound.** Cosmetic sounds, such as a victory sting, never replace or mask a gameplay cue.
- **A setting** shows opponents in their default cosmetics, for readability or taste.
