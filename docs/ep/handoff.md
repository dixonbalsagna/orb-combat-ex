# EP handoff

This file is for a fresh Executive Producer session. Read it first, then docs/ep/playbook.md, ADR 0005 and docs/ep/vision.md. Memory has the essentials too.

## State on 2026-09-29
- P0 is in progress. Line references into the prototype are pinned to commit 7233c96.
- Committed and accepted:
  - QA: seeded sim, baseline, regression suite and baseline-diff (811629e, 18e6e4d; ADR 0004).
  - Legal wave 1 (29786e3), accepted with fixes.
  - Narrative: names, glossary and places (f253011, 541f97e, 5311aa6).
  - Wave-1 briefs for 15 directors (docs/ep/briefs/wave1/, 40bb119).
  - The routing checklist (docs/ep/wave1-sequencing.md).
- Orb answered questionnaire 1 (docs/ep/vision.md). The verbatim fighter notes are in .private/, local only. Questionnaire 2 was posted in chat on 2026-09-29.

## Directors (lean team, ADR 0005)
- **Active:**
  - Simulation: finish the port and its parity checks.
  - Research: finish the engine spike.
  - Game Design: design docs reflecting Orb's answers.
  - Legal: review the fighter concepts for IP risk; prepare going public.
  - Narrative: pitch titles.
- **Paused mid-work.** Resume these later with "continue your brief":
  - Combat (move grammar)
  - Encounter Systems (director docs)
  - QA (known-bugs register)
- **Briefed but not started.** Hold these until their phase, and update their briefs with vision.md before resuming them: Tools, Production, Art, Camera, World, Netcode, Controls, Performance, UI & UX, Accessibility, VFX, Audio, Animation, Community. Their briefs are in docs/ep/briefs/wave1/.
- **Charters written, sessions not yet opened:**
  - Rendering & Technical Art: open at the engine decision.
  - Modding & Extensibility: open later.

## The sim port has landed (2026-09-29)
- The port is committed, with parity against 7233c96 proven. `npm test --prefix sim` passes (unit, parity and soak; about 2 minutes).
- Ownership has passed, to be announced when each director resumes:
  - sim/world/ to World
  - sim/director/ to Encounter Systems
  - sim/input/ to Controls
- Next for Simulation:
  - the QA-002 split and the QA-004 event log, after Netcode's requests;
  - an N-fighter state model, when the roster work starts. sim/README.md lists every place that assumes two fighters.
- Needs a ruling from Game Design and Controls: a human can switch stance while locked in an exchange and take 0.38x damage (sim/README.md, bug 3).
- For ADR 0001: docs/architecture/determinism.md recommends deterministic binary64 floats with our own trig functions. It advises against C# for the sim while Godot C# can't export to the browser.

## GDScript port and fx split (2026-09-29)
- The GDScript sim is bit-identical to the det-mode JS core (26479d5), and CI runs the Godot parity job on Linux.
- The QA-002 split has landed: the sim holds only gameplay state, and cosmetic effects arrive as fx events (docs/architecture/fx-events.md). Tick mean 35 µs; projected worst case on an old laptop 1.4 to 2.4 ms.
- Ownership of sim/world, sim/director and sim/input (both twins) now passes to World, Encounter Systems and Controls. Announce it in each one's next brief. The JS core stays the oracle; any sim change touches both twins and the goldens.
- Give docs/architecture/fx-events.md to Rendering (first brief), VFX, Camera and Audio. The 'camera' and 'audio' stream ids are reserved for them.
- Simulation's next items (held): integer tick timers (determinism.md hazard 1), before Netcode's rollback work.

## Greybox (2026-09-29)
- Rendering's greybox is committed (2ebdb53): F5 plays the GDScript sim AI vs AI in 2.5D, and any key takes P1. Seam sweep and render determinism tools pass. Desktop frame 0.98 ms, web 1.83 ms (high-end machine only).
- Tools is working on a web export preset, the render tools in CI, and a Pages deploy at /play/. Flipping Pages to deploy through Actions needs Orb's OK.

## Questionnaire 3 wave (2026-09-29)
- **Active now:**
  - Game Design: the meter-less damage model and pacing (damage-model.md).
  - Combat: procedural movesets (procedural-moves.md).
  - Narrative: the signature pitches (orbs, multiplier, Cyborg food and core, transformations, fusion, tail) and the line system.
  - Simulation: GDScript becomes the source of truth; the JS core is frozen (ADR 0006 draft).
- **Next, once Simulation's switch lands (goldens are then GD-only):**
  - World (with Rendering): craters, not canyons. The ground gets depth. Impacts make round bowls with rims and ejecta, sized by energy; a diagonal slam skids into a bowl. The z=0 slice must equal the sim's groundY. Beams scorch and leave trails of destruction that scale with power (vision.md). Also simple water flow, and a planet that reads full-scale.
  - Encounter Systems: fights stuck in the ocean; more launches across the map; the tempo changes from Game Design.
  - Rendering: civilians too small; planet-scale feel.
  - Legal: screen Narrative's favourites, the true-merge fusion and the redesigned tail.
- **Pinned for Game Design later:** planet destruction and stage transitions (the mantle and lava, zero-g space).
- **Audio, when active:** per-character grunts, growls and laughs that carry unvoiced text lines.

## After questionnaire 3 (2026-09-29, later)
- ADR 0006 is committed: GDScript first, JS frozen at 9ac1ea9, goldens from golden.gd, batch.gd for AI batches. **Only one director changes sim behaviour at a time**, so golden.json doesn't collide in the shared folder.
- **Orb's picks:**
  - Damage: Wounds.
  - Cyborg food: Press.
  - Overcommit liked, but to be made recognisable and non-infringing (Narrative round 2).
  - Orbs and fusion: re-pitch (Narrative round 2). Keep the pride-for-power mechanic.
- **Active:**
  - Encounter Systems: tempo, launch planner, ocean. The only sim editor right now.
  - Rendering: civilian scale, planet-scale feel.
  - Narrative: round 2 pitches.
- **Standing by:**
  - Game Design: writes the Wounds spec after Orb picks the readout, Rally and downtime.
  - Combat: stage 0/1 after the spec. The composer's code lives in sim/director (Encounter owns it); Combat owns the vocabulary as data.
  - Simulation.
- **Next sim editor after Encounter:** World, one brief covering:
  - rims are gameplay (EP ruling), so the 1D profile gets raised rims and wider, shallower bowls sized by energy;
  - fx events 'crater' (x, ground y, r, depth, energy, cause) and 'scorch' (x, ground y, width, power, variant, owner) with defined energy and power scalars;
  - a persistent crater list in state, for replay seek and snapshots;
  - sim quirk 7 (a crater every 36 units along low beams) replaced by scorch trails that scale with beam power;
  - simple water flow;
  - launched fighters skim water (a sim/core/fighter.gd edit, routed via Simulation if needed).
  Then Rendering draws the crater bowls in depth (the z=0 slice equals the sim) and the scorch trails.
- **Tools, small:** fix the godot-parity comment (it now checks the GD goldens); add a batch.gd 5-match smoke step. QA: move baselines to batch.gd.

## Plan upgrade (2026-09-29)
Orb upgraded the subscription ('more tokens to play with, keep going'). More directors may work in parallel on non-sim tracks. Workflows and ultracode still need Orb's per-task OK (ADR 0005). Newly active: Art (look v0 and the Anti-hero concept), UI & UX (the no-health-bar HUD in ui/), QA (move to batch.gd, Wounds test skeletons), Audio (direction and grunt palettes). Ping Orb whenever a new playable build is live.

## Audio follow-ups (2026-09-29)
- The event list in docs/audio/direction.md §9 goes to Simulation (S1 events) and Encounter (S2). Needed: damage with attacker, victim, region and kind; beam_fire, beam_end and beam_clash; transform, tier_up, heat_stage, boil_over, fold and encore; hide, found, ambush and lock_lost; building and world events.
- Rendering applies audio's 4-line hook in sim_host.gd and main.gd (audio/README.md) after its visual fix.
- Grunt names: Narrative's gesture, intensity and mood names map to Audio's recipes. Narrative owns caption strings; UI displays them.
- Legal: origin rows AUD-GEN-001, AUD-GEN-002 and AUD-PREV-001; screen the beam and Press sound rules (direction.md §5.2 to 5.3).

## Collateral ramp and cap (Game Design §4b)
World builds it with B1: a rolling 60 s budget by tier (evacuation, not deaths, over budget), a cumulative ceiling (10, 30, 60 and 90%), and per-casualty weights times 425/pop0. Narrative and World make evacuation read as fleeing. QA adds the rolling-window test, the ceiling test and the per-tier split.

## Later queue items
- World, after B2: carve real fissure notches into S.deform so split ground reads at the profile (VFX's surface cracks are subtle at the grazing camera).
- A launch planner pass with the open-ground spawn and B2: launches are 10.8 a minute after the dynamic slice (Encounter).

## ON HOLD (2026-09-30, late): the control scheme, ADR 0008
Orb decided the new control scheme, three controller layouts and the Simple mobile mode, and asked everyone to wait for further instruction (Orb may want more consulting). Briefed with a HOLD: UI, Encounter and Tools. Not running when briefed, so brief them on restart: Controls (redesign Stages A to C), Combat (energy and physical piece families, context actions, fewer beams), Game Design (perfect block, burst and cancel costs, power layer, context priorities, Simple automatic choices, placeholder transform, pitch the pick-one-of-three upgrade draft), Animation (energy variants, context poses), Simulation (the SimIntent extension, review of Encounter's location slice lines). Also pending: Encounter's location slice (uncommitted, all gates green; needs Simulation's review and Tools' four schema differences); QA's M1b tuning partials (decay 3 with floors 0/600/1800/2700, style revision 3 passes; wound runs unfinished); World and VFX notes from Orb (terrain-deformation oddities, trails curving while flying straight, natural formations as smashable foreground, islands with villages and vehicles).

## Sim queue, current (2026-09-30, evening)
Done since the list below: the dynamic slice, World's fixes, k 0.034, D1a, the brink experiments, the crippling moment (pitch A) with the battered-at-start rule.
1. D1b (Simulation, active): wire meters and ladder losslessly, then Game Design's numbers (care 0, menace 5% and 0.01, cripple 0.08 and ±0.05, guardWearSplit 0.6/0.4). Tools' meters and wounds schemas are waiting in the tree for the same commit. Then QA re-runs 800 matches (KAI at least 42%, the arm/leg split, length).
2. World: B2 (Rampage floors), then districts and the two big cities.
3. M1 mood and style. 4. Controls Stage A. 5. Combat M0 (move grammar skeleton) with Simulation's part cue for Animation's A2. 6. Encounter Q4 checkpoints (variety pass, the crippling set piece, trailing help, time cap A at 11:00). 7. Controls Stages B and C. 8. F1.
Queued for when cosmetics are built: Tools (the data/unlocks and cosmetics schemas, the palette colour-blind validator, the profile save), UI (collection screen, lobby fallback), Narrative (titles and challenge names). Orb to decide: an unlock-all setting, player-made palettes.

## Sim queue, previous (2026-09-30, after questionnaire 4)
1. Encounter's dynamic-feel slice (blocked on Orb's go-ahead in the Encounter session; its auto mode denied the cross-owner edit).
2. World: underwater placement fix, the shoreline −240 fix, RELOCATE on with evacuee menace, then B2 (Rampage floors), then districts and two big cities.
3. D1a (Simulation).
4. M1, mood and style (Simulation; plan docs/architecture/mood-style.md; numbers in spec-wounds §9; thresholds in docs/narrative/style.draft.json).
5. Controls Stage A. 6. D1b. 7. Encounter's Q4 checkpoints A to E (with Combat's variety pass, data/combat/styles.json). 8. Controls Stages B and C. 9. F1 (the Anti-hero).
Tools: schemas for combat styles, fight mood and fight style (no sim edits).

## Sim queue, revised again (Orb's pace feedback)
World (active), then Encounter's dynamic-feel slice (profile dynamic, cooldown, AI cadence, no close-range halts, the beam-dodge hang, the overtime ramp, k), then D1a, then Controls Stage A, then D1b, then Controls Stage B, then F1.
Push hold: local commit 9794840 (Tools' schemas expect flashes v3) waits until Rendering's flash v3 code lands. Then commit flashes.json v3, the audio retime and the render changes together, check a clean export, and push.

## Sim queue, revised (2026-09-29, night)
World (collateral, B1, anguish, slide pop, structures index; active), then D1a (Simulation), then Controls Stage A, then D1b, then Encounter's overtime ramp and k 0.06, then Controls Stage B, then F1 (the Anti-hero). Tools is doing schemas and the validator in parallel (no sim edits).

## Sim queue, previous order (2026-09-29, late)
S3b Encounter (active), then S4 Simulation (Rally, plus the second-breath metric), then World (collateral ramp and cap, B1 in bh, pop per slide, structures index), then Controls Stage A (integer hit-stop, press ticks, SimIntent special, transform and stanceStep; goldens bit-identical), then Controls Stage B (the hit-stop table; goldens change).

## Encounter, next small slice (after World)
The overtime ramp: after 9:00, k rises 25% per minute (spec-wounds §2). Lower k from 0.065 to 0.06 (Game Design confirmed). Targets: timeouts at most 1% at the cap, p10 at least 5:00, median 6:00 to 8:00. Also the contest tilt of -10 per Rally, and the AI's use of Rally.

## QA follow-ups (Game Design)
- Re-baseline the collateral bands after B1.
- If chapters feel thin after S4, run the stricter-brink experiment (core or three limbs broken, k ×1.4).

## Sim editor queue (one at a time; the plan is docs/architecture/wounds-plan.md)
S0 menace fixes (Simulation, active), S1 wear core, then SC world scale plus W-R rim scaling (World first, then Simulation, then Encounter's tempo pass; one golden regen; docs/world/scale.md; about 2,000 bh planet; 10-20 s lap), B1 building depth data (World), LD1 fire and smoke cover (World and Encounter), then (with the ko() hook behind a flag), S2 the end (Encounter), S3a and S3b, S4 Rally, B2 the building brunt (Encounter, World, Simulation; docs/world/buildings-in-depth.md), with B3 building presentation (Rendering, Camera) in parallel after B1, LD2 landslides, then LD3 lava, quakes and rifts (Orb's picks; docs/world/living-destruction.md), then D1 roster as data, then F1: the **Anti-hero** (Orb's pick). W1 (variable circumference) comes before the fold; N1 (N bodies) comes before the Empress.

## Old sim queue notes
1. World: craters, scorch, water (active).
2. Simulation: Game Design's menace placeholder fixes (balance-targets.md §9: decay 0.4/s after 4 s without a villain-caused casualty; menace damage cap from +25% to +15%). Also add tempo.gd to the sim/README layout table.
3. Wounds implementation (spec-wounds.md): Encounter Systems and Combat (stage 0/1). QA re-baselines on batch.gd, then tests KAI at 42% or better, with at least 400 matches per arm.

## Queued for idle directors (send when they resume)
- **Camera:** when separation passes half the planet, the reference camera re-targets the other arc and pans 80 to 180 px per frame. That's a framing choice to fix.
- **Performance:** a min-spec run (old laptop, integrated GPU, mobile), draw-call budgets, and the float-texture vertex fetch on mobile GLES3 (the fallback is packed 8-bit heights).
- **Simulation:** in sim.gd, createSim labels its fx mode 'shared' and rejects 'split', though the docs say det plus split (label only).
- **QA:**
  - Raise the match cap to 900 s for game-scale batches.
  - Split casualties by tier.
  - Run the fixed-stance probe (docs/design/stance-matrix.md §6).
  - Its known-bugs register is mid-way.
- **Combat:**
  - Second outcomes per stance cell (Game Design R3), finisher templates and CUT-IN beats.
  - LANE SWEEP: Game Design supports it for P4 if it plays differently, e.g. a long shallow trench, and Legal screens the name.
  - Use CANOPY BURN and TIDE CLEAVE in place of FIRESTORM and HORIZON CLEAVE.
- **Controls:** the missed-parry cost (5 ki and a 0.5 s lock) and visible windows.
- **Encounter Systems:**
  - The AI attacks from ESCAPE and uses ambushes.
  - Fix where fights happen (69% of beams fire over the ocean) and launch variety.
- **World:** collateral mechanisms that meet the bands in docs/design/balance-targets.md, including a civilian floor for the Cyborg.
- **Narrative:**
  - Names for the ego meters (Respect, Pride, Wrath, Hunger) and for the replacement mechanics.
  - The fighter bible, after Orb picks the replacements.
- **Legal:**
  - Register rows LR-020 to LR-023, once Tools reports.
  - The place-name screen.
  - A final check of the licence files at the repo root.
  - Register Research's dev tools. None of them is in the repo:
    - Godot 4.7.2 export templates (MIT, SHA-512 checked)
    - the Godot 4.7.2 .NET editor and its .NET export templates (MIT; scratch use only)
    - TypeScript 7.0.2 via npx (Apache-2.0; an optional type-check, dev only)
  - Register the CI actions (CI only, shipped nowhere; confirm the licences): actions/checkout v7.0.1 @ 3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 and actions/setup-node v7.0.0 @ 820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020. Also the Godot 4.7.2 Linux zip used by the CI parity job.
  - Register @napi-rs/canvas 1.0.9 (MIT, dev-only, optional; github.com/Brooooooklyn/canvas) and its per-platform prebuilt packages (same scope and version; confirm each licence). Pinned in prototype/package-lock.json.
  - The licence files were removed on 2026-09-29 while Orb decides; update the licence register to match.
  - Stages 4 and 5 on the title, once Orb picks.
- **Tools:**
  - Rerun the generator after any charter edit.
  - Add the licence fields, .github/CONTRIBUTING.md and the PR template from docs/legal/contributor-rules.md.

## Open decisions for Orb
- Game Design's G1 to G15 and 29 per-system questions (docs/design/open-questions.md, systems-sketch.md). The most urgent:
  - How a 7-minute match ends.
  - Whether the last segment needs a finisher.
  - Whether a fighter can be hit while transforming.
  - What a human playing the Tyrant controls.
  - Tandem versus Unison.
- Legal's replacement picks (docs/legal/fighter-concepts-review.md); the tyrant's tail; whether fusion becomes a mod or is dropped.
- The README pitch line (docs/legal/public-readiness-edits.md §5).
- The title.
- The copyright holder's name.
- Lemming Ball Z provenance.
- Renaming the repo before it goes public.
- The outcome of Legal's fighter-concept review.
- Answers to questionnaire 2.

## Critical path to something playable
1. **ADR 0001 (engine choice): done.** Godot 4.7 with GDScript, confirmed by Orb on 2026-09-29.
2. **A greybox 1v1 on a wrapped planet.** Port the sim core into the chosen engine, with a greybox 2.5D renderer (Simulation, Rendering & Technical Art) and keyboard and gamepad input (Controls).
3. **Then the content:** polish the stance director (Combat, Encounter Systems, Game Design), then build the four fighters and their transformations.

## Practical notes
- **Messaging.** Send messages with SendMessage to exact session titles ("Meridian - <role>"). Directors reply the same way. Don't subscribe to idle notices.
- **Git.** Only the EP commits. The QA suite is `node qa/run-all.js` on Node 24.19.0.
- **Godot.** 4.7.2 is at C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Godot\4.7.2\, with export templates installed.
