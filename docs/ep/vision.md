# Orb's vision (questionnaire 1, 2026-09-28)

Orb's answers to the first scope-and-vision questionnaire, summarised by the EP. Every director reads this before working on anything it touches. Orb's full notes on the fighters are kept locally in .private/orb-answers-2026-09-28.md. They name franchise inspirations, so never quote them into a committed file.

## Tone and feel

**Tone.** All four tones at once: mature violence and destruction on a planetary scale, a humorous voice, and a sincere, respectful homage to the source anime's aesthetics. Orb's line is "staples yes, signatures no".

**Match feel.** A match is the finale of a bitter rivalry after a whole season of build-up, compressed into an epic showdown of seven minutes or more. It has one-liners, carnage, destruction and high stakes, like a full-throttle reimagining of a lost high-octane flash game. It is never two fighters trading aimless jabs from opposite corners. Combat looks choreographed, seamless and exhilarating, and it expresses each fighter's identity at every moment.

**Carried over from the fan-game predecessors:** comedy, free flight, huge arenas, beam struggles, transformations, destruction, playing with friends, and a modding scene.

## The four fighters

These are archetypes. Legal is checking them against "staples yes, signatures no" in docs/legal/fighter-concepts-review.md (pending). Design mechanics so they survive re-skinning.

1. **The Protagonist.** An earnest martial artist with a handful of epic transformations that unlock along parallel tracks. He powers up when a challenger gives everything they have. He fights to protect his loved ones, but his fixation on the fight itself causes massive collateral damage. He has a huge hand-to-hand repertoire, strategic teleports mid-attack, and ends fights with an all-out energy finisher. His unique ability: he gathers scattered artefacts to move the fight somewhere no one else can get hurt. Once there, he reveals his final form.
2. **The Anti-hero.** A brooding rival whose sense of justice comes second to his ego and pride. He has a few epic transformations that boost both his power and his self-importance. His style is brutal and showy: he drags fights out to enforce his own sense of hierarchy, bombards the foe with elaborate energy barrages until they submit, then finishes them by hand. The player chooses whether he wins on his own strength or accepts a fusion item thrown by the Protagonist. Fusing creates a stronger combined fighter with its own visuals and abilities.
3. **The Galactic Tyrant.** He starts by watching from behind two or three autonomous minions, who take turns fighting. Once they fall, he transforms through a comically long chain of stages (ten or more), each with a subtly different moveset, up to a full-power form with its own abilities. He torments foes with precise cutting beams from range and uses tail attacks and dominant power attacks. His personality: confident, leering, boastful and quick to anger.
4. **The Demon Cyborg.** He consumes civilians to power up, each one adding a small multiplicative bonus. He then molts into a form that can turn nearby civilians into sandwiches, which grant further bonuses. His final form requires hunting down and eating his small demon companion, which is hidden somewhere on the planet. In that form he is the fastest fighter of all, blitzing through portals that spew monstrous sandwiches, a light-hearted parody. His body is dark red, wrapped in mechanical wiring and chainmail-like electrical parts. His true vital point is a stylised quantum microchip in a translucent orb; the rest of his flesh regenerates.

More characters must be addable after launch (see the Modding and Extensibility charter).

## Questionnaire 3 (2026-09-29): gameplay and features

Orb had played the Godot greybox before answering.

| Topic | Answer |
|---|---|
| Greybox pace | Too fast |
| Next priorities | Better fighting feel, the first real fighter, bigger destruction |
| Health | **No health meters.** Location-based damage, where each fighter handles incoming damage slightly differently. Tension and dramatic build-up without traditional bars |
| Finisher | Always: the last blow is a fighter-specific finisher |
| Planet destruction | Pinned. Explore large-scale destruction (molten lava spewing from the mantle) short of full destruction, zero-g combat in space if the planet does go, and how stage transitions work |
| One-liners | Both: barks during play and short pauses at set pieces |
| Cinematics | Yes, and longer than 3 s is fine |
| Ego meters | Yes, visible (Respect, Pride, Wrath, Hunger) |
| Hit while transforming | Long transformations can be interrupted; the Tyrant's quick revisions are safe |
| Transform timing | Per fighter |
| Form duration | Permanent, except drain states |
| Transformations | Power-ups and transformations are genre staples, and Orb wants the space explored further. The beast stage was only an example |
| Multiplier stage | Pitch a replacement |
| Artefacts | Orb wants orbs: find a non-infringing way to include them. A heavy hit scatters one |
| Teleport tell | A ripple in the air |
| Anti-hero fusion | A true merge with an original trigger and look (Legal screens it) |
| Tyrant appendage | Keep a tail, redesigned so it doesn't read as the franchise's |
| Tyrant forms | The numbered "revision" joke |
| Human Tyrant during the goon phase | Snipes support shots and taunts |
| Goons | Three: bruiser, marksman, speedster |
| Cyborg food mechanic | Pitch it |
| Cyborg companion | A backup drive that runs around; he catches and docks it |
| Cyborg weak point | Pitch it |
| Asymmetric roster | Yes, with win rates still 45 to 55% |
| Planets | Earth-like and alien biomes; day and night plus weather; bigger for 2v2 |
| 2v2 revive | Yes, with a risky beat next to the fallen teammate |
| Mirror matches | Yes in 1v1, not on the same team |
| Unlocks | Everything unlocked from the start |

**Greybox notes (Orb's words):** "destructible terrain should look more like craters than canyons, water should have a simple fluid simulation, fighters seem to always fight in the ocean underwater, civilians seem too tiny, more attacks launching each other across the map, make the scale of the map seem more like a full planet"

**Anything else (Orb's words):** "I want procedural systems to create near limitless sets of attacks. Voice lines don't have to be voice-acted, if each character has distinct grunts and growls and laughs those could be used to evoke emotionality of lines that appear on the screen. I want one liners and taunts and reactions that depend on all kinds of variables, so there should be a very large set of lines that can potentially be seen accounting for every situation. the combat director I'm envisioning needs to be able to create extremely vast movesets for each character, with some unique special abilities for each character, but each fight should feel unique, with dynamic combos and attacks that gives the player the sense they're not going to see the same exact series of attacks twice."
**Craters and beams (Orb, confirmed 2026-09-29).** Ground impacts make round bowls with raised rims and ejecta, sized by impact energy. They're localised in depth, not slots through the whole ground strip. Beams scorch and leave trails of destruction, and the results scale up with the beam's power: stronger beams are more intense and more destructive.

**Damage model (Orb, 2026-09-29).** Variant A, Wounds (docs/design/damage-model.md). Game Design pitches: the optional wear readout; Rally rules per fighter (Orb: 'I'm thinking per-fighter'); and the downtime between exchanges. For downtime, the player flies freely, with dynamic set pieces and quick verbal exchanges. Pitch ideas that keep it engaging.

**Signature picks (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- Cyborg food: Press.
- Cyborg weak point: Rail chip.
- Tyrant's tail: Bladed mantle, a cape with blade hems used like a tail.
- Protagonist power stage: Overcommit, made recognisable but non-infringing (Narrative round 2).
- Orbs: recognisable but non-infringing (Narrative round 2, within Legal's q3-screen §a).
- Fusion: may be replaced by a unique Anti-hero power-up; keep 'sacrifice pride for power'.
- Wear readout: a combination of the aura crown with wound cards and the silhouette, per fighter (Game Design pitches).
- Rally: Game Design's four per-fighter Rallies approved, with looser limits.

**Round 3 answers (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- Power stage: 'something like his blood goes from heated to simmering to boiling, causing internal damage that adds up but gives big temporary boosts.'
- Anti-hero power-up: keep working. Orb wants it 'recognizable but non-infringing' and asks whether fair-use and parody rules can protect a good-faith tribute (Legal to explain).
- Voices: 'good start, let's work on this further.'
- The orb-payoff question was unclear; the EP is re-asking it plainly.

**Round 4 answers (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- Hot Blood: the mechanic, cards, look and sound are liked. Names are **pinned**: Orb will think up names later, and they must not sound LLM-generated. Treat all current names as placeholders.
- Anti-hero: Orb likes Drop the Act (1v1) and Humbled. Keep pitching ideas in that theme.
- The orb payoff (the fold to the proving ground): **space folds inward** toward the Protagonist and the planet vanishes around them. It needs an in-world reason, with the hero saying something like 'we can't hurt anyone innocent here'.

**Focus and matchups (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- **1v1 first.** 2v2 questions (the fold in 2v2, team rules) are deferred.
- Lines change with the matchup: who is facing whom, and what is at stake. The Protagonist is lighter against a sparring rival and more serious against someone threatening to end the world.
- Work the matchups out case by case with Orb.

**Matchup feedback (Orb, 2026-09-29).** 'These are a great start. I want as many possibilities.' Likes: the Tyrant's revision numbers, and the Cyborg asking for a manager. Tone fix for the Protagonist: the fight comes first and the repairs after. Not 'That was a home. I'll fix it. Then I'll deal with you.', but more like 'I'll help fix it once I'm done with you.' Orb read the Anti-hero's 'Fifth.' as a typo for 'Filth'.

**The Tyrant becomes an Empress (Orb, 2026-09-29).** The Galactic Tyrant is now a galactic empress (she/her). Everything else carries over (the revision joke, three goons, the bladed mantle, the surveyor line), and Narrative pitches how she's rewritten. Legal's revision 9 to 12 silhouette and palette rule still applies.

**The Empress, picks (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- Who she is: 'very image focused, hates to have to change appearances, so has settled on their base form to keep paperwork tidy. Since the fight pushes them to transform, they need to update their paperwork to keep their legal status current. Bureaucratic and confusing on purpose. Let's work on this theme.'
- Goons: Guard of honour.
- Voice: approved (revision numbers, a royal 'we' that slips to 'I' when hurt, opponents are 'petitioner').

**Transformations are respected (Orb, 2026-09-29; this overrides questionnaire 3's 'long ones interruptible').** 'With few exceptions, I think the transformations should be cinematic and uninterruptible. The gauge or some mechanic must fill or otherwise complete, which can be stopped, but once the transformation happens it should be respected the way anime characters seem to traditionally allow their opponent to transform.' Also: the Empress's backdated-filing comeback, Orb is unsure ('I don't know about this'), so pitch alternatives. The rule that her filings don't register in the fold is dropped: her filings work everywhere.

**Empress paperwork is diegetic only (Orb, 2026-09-29).** 'I don't like the idea of visible paperwork or stamps. She could have voice lines about how frustrating it will be to go through the mountain of paperwork later, or some other diegetic clues as to what's going on.' No stamp cards and no visible forms. The paperwork lives in her lines and in in-world clues. The Appeal is not approved: pitch her comeback again without visible paperwork. The fold becomes a respected cinematic (yes, same rule).

**Empress comeback, round 2 (Orb, 2026-09-29).** None of Off the record, Close ranks or Recess approved: 'pitch more ideas. I like a straightforward brawl that must defeat the guards before getting to the empress, damage transference isn't exactly how I imagined the character.' The retinue rule is rejected: fallen guards leave, and the gestures come from her remaining guard or from her.

**Empress comeback: Encore (Orb, 2026-09-29).** On the brink, all three guard return for a short, harder second goon phase while she withdraws, snipes and taunts. If they hold, one region mends; if they fall first, she is on the brink and in reach. Once per match.

**First real fighter: the Anti-hero (Orb, 2026-09-29).** Built after the Wounds slices and roster-as-data (docs/architecture/wounds-plan.md).

**Rims and buildings (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- Crater rim height depends on how hard the impact is: harder hits throw up taller rims.
- Buildings exist in both the foreground and the background (depth layers). Normal movement never collides with them, and neither do most launches. The director chooses when a launched fighter crashes destructively into a building, and it should often pick an individual building to take the brunt of an impact. This is part of stage design.

**Building impacts (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- No rooftop cover.
- Targeting is a mix of personality and drama, weighted toward personality: the villain seeks tall, occupied towers and the hero avoids occupied ones.
- One impact can go through several buildings: 'a classic villain trope is to send the hero careening through multiple skyscrapers in one attack.'
- Anguish weight: Game Design's default (no extra multiplier) stands unless Orb says otherwise.

**Life-size scale (Orb, 2026-09-29).** 'Right now everything looks very small compared to the fighters. I'd like to see a much larger world with buildings and civilians scaled up to be life-size compared to the fighters.' World is drafting docs/world/scale.md, to land before building-depth slice B1.

**Scale answers (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- Planet size between small and medium ('between 1 and 2', maybe larger after it's felt). Fighters should launch each other through the landscape and into different biomes several times per fight.
- A flat-out dash around the planet takes 10 to 20 s: anime-fast.
- Destruction: 'as the fighters power up, the destructiveness should keep scaling. Implement novel ways to keep this interesting so the players don't just see it as map painting, but rather interfering and actively engaging with a real landscape.'

**Living destruction picks (Orb, 2026-09-29).** From docs/world/living-destruction.md: fire and smoke cover (with cover made and taken), landslides, and the top-tier set: lava, quakes and rifts. Build order: LD1 fire and smoke, then LD2 landslides, then the tier-4 lava, quakes and rifts, leading toward the pinned planet-destruction finale.

**Blast-levelled buildings (Orb, 2026-09-29).** When an impact or ground blast craters a city, the buildings it levels collapse into their own footprint like a controlled demolition, and leave rubble behind.

**Knockback slide (Orb, 2026-09-29, after playing the craters build).** Orb likes the craters build. Against ground, a launched fighter shouldn't bounce and leave several craters. Impacts should be weighted toward a **knockback slide**: 'a character is hit with immense force or is braking from high-speed movement, dragging their feet or hands along the ground to stay upright, which leaves a deep trench, shatters concrete, and kicks up massive clouds of dust.' On water, a shallow incline skips the fighter across the surface (bouncing is good there). Orb also noted 'some visual peculiarities we can touch up'.

**Audio picks (Orb, 2026-09-29).** Grunts are synthesised first, and Orb may record laughs and the munch later. AI-generated audio is allowed once Legal clears the specific tool's terms. Wear and heat audio is on by default, with a slider. The music direction will be picked by ear from Audio's three 30-second sketches.

**Anti-hero look, round 1 (Orb, 2026-09-29).** None of Art's three silhouettes (Column, Bell, Standard) picked yet: pitch more. No cape. Shed Regalia: pitch it later. The music pick is pending until Orb listens.

**HUD clutter (Orb, 2026-09-29).** The aura crown rings should pop up for a moment when something happens (a hit, a stage change), then fade back. No persistent clutter in the way of the fight choreography. 'Let's revise this because it looks like a good start.'

**Character art direction (Orb, 2026-09-29).** F, the Coil, is 'a good start' for the Anti-hero. Orb isn't happy with the character designs yet and wants them **striking and recognizable**, with more style passes. Faceless or blank heads could be a style choice if the style is distinct enough. Art proposes several overall character art directions. Legal's note stands: nothing borrowed from Madness Combat's look.

**Character art direction, round 2 (Orb, 2026-09-29).** Blank is the closest and a good starting point. Pitch more styles and mock-ups building from it. Faces: pitch it, Orb wants a unique style. Poster: disliked ('the color scheme is too jarring'), and its use for key art is undecided.

**Staging the fighters: cheat out (Orb, 2026-09-29).** No strict side profile. Fighters turn slightly toward the camera, three-quarter, as stage actors 'cheat out', so stances, chest designs, limbs and demeanour read. Three techniques, as in modern 2.5D fighters:
1. Rotate the torso, hips and head toward the camera.
2. A hybrid projection: the background keeps perspective, and the fighters get an orthographic-style correction so they don't warp at the screen edges.
3. Mirroring when fighters switch sides, so the front always faces the camera and the back is never shown.
Orb also referenced 'downstage' stage power: being nearer the camera reads as commanding.

**Character style: Marked plus Aura (Orb, 2026-09-29).** Combine Marked (a mask with a bold sigil per fighter that bends with emotion and grows with form) and Aura: 'make sure the aura is there to exaggerate or convey appropriately.' Mask tone is per fighter (pale or dark). Orb wants mock-ups in the new style that follow the blocking rules (cheat out to camera).

**Mask tones and transient aura (Orb, 2026-09-29).** Mask tones approved: Protagonist and Empress pale, Anti-hero and Cyborg dark. The aura, like the HUD graphics around the fighters, seems distracting as a constant presence. It should convey emotion briefly and then disappear. Orb is unsure about blades or column from screenshots alone and wants to judge it in motion.

**Head flashes (Orb, 2026-09-29).** The transient aura should work like a brief flash around the head, in the spirit of a superhero's danger-sense flash, or a stealth game's '!' and '?' marks over an enemy's head. These are short, iconic state and emotion pops (comics call them emanata). Staples yes, signatures no: nothing that copies a specific franchise's squiggle design or alert sound.

**Head flashes, answers (Orb, 2026-09-29).** The flash set: pitch changes (Orb wants options before settling on twelve). Info flashes (danger sense, found, searching) are a setting, on by default.

**Flash set (Orb, 2026-09-29).** Add Hazard (info), Primed (info) and Respect (emotion). Cuts were left to the EP ('keep it dynamic and engaging'). EP ruling: cut Brink (the crown's brink ring covers it); keep Resolve as the Rally's emotional beat, firing after the crown's wear pop fades; keep Pride separate from Triumph. That makes 14 flashes, 5 of them info. Winded, Smug and Bored are held until the prototype proves the core set.

**Dynamic split screen (Orb, 2026-09-29).**
- Split only when zooming out further would make the fighters too small to read.
- A dynamic angled divider that tilts toward the other fighter.
- Panes always point toward each other along the shortest way round, and swap with a smooth slide when the shortest way flips, with hysteresis so it never flickers.
- Merge: a dissolve when flying back together; the divider slams shut when charging in to attack.
- Solo against the AI: the player chooses in settings.
- Hiding: the hunter's pane shows only a search view, and the hider's pane is normal.
- A small ring map of the planet shows both fighters.
- Launches: follow the launched fighter in a short cinematic, then split if they land far away.
- Orb questions whether hiding earns its place ('maybe it could be something for a character we introduce down the line'). The EP pitches it; see the next entry.

**Hiding saved for a future fighter (Orb, 2026-09-29).** Hiding is removed from the base game and becomes the signature of a later stealth-specialist character. Cover stays as line-of-sight only (smoke, rubble and terrain can break lock-on). The ambush bonus, the Primed flash and hide-based recovery go with it and are held for that fighter.

**Playtest feedback (Orb, 2026-09-29, night, on the live build).**
- Bug: a fighter often hits the ground hard with no crater, bounces, and the second, lighter impact leaves a large crater. Some deformation on existing craters looks strange.
- Crater size: tune it way down for most impacts. Save the largest craters for special attacks and highly telegraphed, obviously extra-powerful knockbacks.
- Head flashes are too large and visible (the surge's blue gas cloud and the giant purple lines obstruct the view). They should quickly pulse two or three times to signal a thought or reaction, then disappear.
- Split screen is good, but it's hard to follow when a fighter picks up a lot of speed. Use simple stylised motion trails, sparingly and effectively, to ground the viewer.
- A friend's feedback: "Love when they carve a trench, some real [genre] stuff. I did like how it zoomed out and showed them flying around the world before though. Maybe set that threshold a bit higher before it automatically splits?"
- Combat feels slower than the prototype: fighters lock together and do nothing for moments before launching attacks. "Let's really nail down the engaging, dynamic feel of combat the prototype had."
- Destruction must be impressive: cracked and split ground, a fighter crashing into a skyscraper and bursting out the other side with glass and steel shrapnel, buildings collapsing.
**Playtest 2 (Orb, 2026-09-30).**
- The skyscraper debris, the building collapse and the particles are a good start.
- Strange geometry:
  - weird ripples and arcs from impacts;
  - the water level against the shoreline looks strange;
  - buildings (often in villages) appear underwater.
  - Ctrl+F6 (embers) showed no visible change.
- Rampage-style skyscrapers: each has floors and windows. A fighter blasted through a building affects individual floors, and enough damage may or may not bring the whole building down.
- Cities should be more varied, expansive and busy-looking.
- A friend's feedback: on mobile, make every touch target and all text responsive. "Not sure what I'm supposed to do in the game… some kind of tutorial or a card explaining how to play would be good."
- **Direction (a core principle):** the player is in charge of macro strategy, pacing and positioning. The fight director is in charge of combos, tactics, blitzing and voice lines.
- **Voice lines, Banjo-Kazooie style:** each character has a distinct voice of grunts, laughs and chattering noises while the captions appear. Lines are chosen automatically from each fighter's stance, position, current or recent actions and anything special that happened. A procedural system sets the mood of the fight and chooses back-and-forth one-liners, reactions, thoughts and taunts that progress over the battle.
- **One battle is a whole set:** a ranked Tekken set takes 7-8 minutes, and one battle here should feel like a whole set of rounds, without health bars, rounds or other fighting-game fixtures.
- **Freshness:** generative, procedural systems should give fresh interactions between fighters again and again, so that across many fights a player still sees lines that are new to them.
- Orb asked for another questionnaire on these systems.
**Questionnaire 4 (Orb, 2026-09-30): fight systems.**
- **The player directly controls:** stance (intent), movement and positioning, attack weight (light, heavy, signature), charging and power-ups, when to transform, and fighter specials (Hot Blood, Drop the Act, Press…).
- **Left to the director:** *when* to attack, and timing presses (parry, the finisher struggle).
- Skill balance: 2 out of 10, so strategy far outweighs execution. Dialogue density: 6 out of 10.
- Set structure: invisible acts, where the director escalates chapter by chapter at body-part breaks and transformations.
- Inner thoughts: yes, often.
- Lines: mostly fresh, plus a few recurring signature lines per fighter.
- The fight's mood drives crowd behaviour and director aggression (more blitzes when heated).
- Move names on screen: only specials, signatures and finishers.
- Skyscraper floors: people on each floor evacuate or are lost; otherwise mostly visual spectacle.
- Cities: a huge skyline, busy life (crowds, traffic, lights), and bigger cities covering more of the planet. **Two big cities.**
- Onboarding: a How-to-play card and a guided first match.
- Mobile: after the first real fighter.
- Music: not picked yet.
- Orb's words: "I want to see threats, boasts, one-liners, banter. It should give my imagination the impression that there are real stakes invested in the battle at hand, and the fighter's personalities should match up with how the player's fighting style is influencing the fight. A player holding defensive patterns all game might see their character think 'Only a little longer...', and a player who plays aggressively then sees his opponent start picking evasive maneuvers could see his character start boasting about their training regimen."
- "I liked the faster fight pace. Now I want to see cleaner combos, more teleport clashing, stylistic flying combat, heavy ground combat, energy blasts, more varied beam struggles."
- Orb will relay friends' feedback as it trickles in.
## Player-facing wording (2026-09-30)
- The player is the fighter. The controls just differ from a traditional fighting game: there are no combos to learn.
- "Strategist" and "the fight director" are internal terms only. Player-facing text states bluntly what the player controls (fly, dash, stance, light or heavy, charge, signature, specials, transform) and that blows and combos play out automatically from those choices.
- Why: it shapes what testers look for and expect.

## Questionnaire 5 (2026-09-30): balance and gameplay
- Match length: 6 to 8 minutes (keep the current target).
- At the time cap: a story event. The planet or a third party intervenes to force an ending (no draw or judges' decision).
- Matchup: even overall, but each fighter wins in different situations (terrain and power tier swing it).
- Momentum: comebacks are common. The trailing fighter gets help.
- Broken limbs: a dramatic swing during the match, not especially common, but a real consideration when playing. Orb asked for a pitch.
- Holding the defensive stance: punished more the longer it is held.
- Escape stance: its odds depend on terrain and distance.
- Signature beams: 2 to 4 a match, each an event.
- Transformations: a big swing that the opponent must respond to.
- Computer opponent: adapts to how the player is doing.
- The choices that should decide who wins: stance reads, charge and energy management, and transformation timing.
- Surprise vs player choice: 6 of 10 (a fair amount of director surprise).
- Anguish: 3 of 10 (mostly emotional, a light handicap).
- Orb only briefly played the latest build; more feedback later.

## Questionnaire 6 (2026-09-30): moveset breadth
- Ambition: hundreds to thousands of basic martial-arts attacks per fighter, dozens to hundreds of specials (energy blasts, advanced footwork, anything unique), dozens of signatures (flashy energy attacks, hidden weapons, secret abilities, ancient knowledge, world-changing abilities), plus a unique transformation mechanic per fighter.
- Building it: a hybrid. Hand-made showcase moves plus a composed fill from a smaller set of hand-made pieces.
- What makes basic attacks different: the limb or body part, reacting to the situation (air, ground, wall, water), the impact and reaction, and the rhythm and speed.
- Recognisability: 3 of 10. Exchanges should mostly look new, not trademark combos.
- Style: a fighter's style shifts during the match with mood, injury and form.
- Specials: a loadout of a few, each with contextual variants.
- Signatures: the place decides (biome, altitude, stance), some are revealed by story moments mid-fight, and some are tied to the transformation stage.
- World-changing abilities: reshape the land, change the sky, move water, and alter the planet itself. Permanent for the rest of the match, at most once per match.
- Hidden weapons and secret abilities: only certain fighters have them.
- Transformation kinds Orb likes: a ladder of forms, a meter-fed state that drains, and shedding power to go faster. Each fighter's mechanic is different.
- Animation: hand-made key poses with procedural in-betweens.
- Priority: the move-building system first, content after.

## Fighter mechanics picks (2026-09-30)
- Broken limbs: pitch A, "the crippling moment" (docs/design/pitches.md §5).
- Time cap: A, the planet gives way.
- World-changing ability owners: revisit, with more ideas pitched first.
- Transformation mechanics per fighter: close, a good start; iterate on the proposals.
- Hidden weapons: only the Cyborg, for now. His final form is what lets him generate his hidden weapons. His technology isn't fully online until he reaches his final form, and those weapons are what give him his distinct power-up.

## World changes and transformations, second pass picks (2026-09-30)
- World changes Orb liked:
  - Protagonist: Heat Wave, Proving Ground.
  - Anti-hero: Storm Crown, Scorched Plain.
  - Empress: Blockade, Golden Hour.
  - Cyborg: Wired World, Harvest.
- Transformations:
  - Empress: the main version, escalating revisions, each adding a signature.
  - Protagonist: the main version, pushing past his limits (heat).
  - Anti-hero: the alternative, pride ascension, with forms lost when Pride crashes.
  - Cyborg: the alternative, assimilation, feeding on wreckage. It keeps the earlier note that his final form brings his technology online and generates his hidden weapons.
- Orb: "take these and pitch more. this is heading in a good direction, I want more ideas to work with."

## Third-pass picks and animation feel (2026-09-30)
- World changes Orb picked from the third pass:
  - Protagonist: Beacon.
  - Anti-hero: Salted Earth.
  - Empress: Grand Avenue.
  - Cyborg: The Stockpot.
- Transformations: keep iterating.
- Motion feel: a mix. Orb: "snappy looks really good, would work well in attack rushes. fluid looks really good, would work well with power strikes."
- Showcase pose author: not decided; keep them as drafts. Orb questioned the hours: the game is meant to be 90% or more vibe-coded.

## Moveset scope and cosmetics (2026-09-30)
- Moveset: start the first fighter at Lean (3 specials, 4 signatures, 6 showcases) to test, then grow by data.
- Cosmetics: leave room for player cosmetic customisation. With four fighters at launch, Orb wants a vast assortment of cosmetics that players unlock through play.

## Unlocks and roster (2026-09-30)
- Yes to an "unlock all cosmetics" setting (off by default). Player-made palettes come later.
- Open, to be decided by Orb within a couple of days: with only four fighters planned, the unlock structure needs serious thought. Orb may expand the launch roster so there can be an arcade mode and a worthy online versus feature. Keep this in mind; don't start roster work until Orb decides.

## Questionnaire 7 (2026-09-30): open questions
- First real fighter (the Lean moveset proof): the Anti-hero.
- Transformations, next round: a bigger visual change per form, and clearer triggers for when you can transform.
- Title clash with the small OrbCombat project: decide later, before the store page.
- Licence: still thinking. Orb wants a full plain-language rundown of every option later, and asked to be reminded along the way.
- Pose review: contact sheets of 12, plus a motion reel per showcase.
- Release: free prototype builds for friends, for now.
- Friends' playtests: yes to an in-game feedback button that copies a report with the match seed.
- Orb asked where the project stands legally when a transformation or motif comes close to existing works, and how far public-domain folklore can be used. Orb wants originality, as a love letter to the genre, not a copy of any series.

## Questionnaire 8 (2026-09-30 evening): answering friends' playtest feedback
- Auto defence: counters only when the defender's stance calls for it, and never automatic beams.
- Manual defence: a block button, a dodge button, and parrying while keeping momentum, with a risk of being stopped.
- Cancel: yes, into a dash or stance change, for an energy cost.
- Beams: fewer beams, more ordinary energy blasts.
- Mashing: fine for beginners; experts should beat it.
- Transform: a working transform in the next build, even a placeholder.
- Ego mechanic (the Anti-hero): later, after his first moveset.
- In-match upgrade draft (pick one of three): pitch options first.
- Mobile touch controls: next build, top priority.
- Onboarding: on-screen control hints during play; shorter How to play cards, fixed for phones.
- Controller support: after the agency fixes.
- Feedback form: Send opens a prefilled GitHub issue.
- Orb's notes:
  - terrain deformation shows weird unexpected behaviour;
  - motion trails curve behind a fighter even when flying straight;
  - large mountains should be background decoration, and fighters should careen through small hills, mesas, rock formations, large trees and other natural formations;
  - idea: one big ocean with small islands and small villages, with locals on bikes and in cars if the scale allows;
  - a proposed Xbox-layout control scheme: four shoulder buttons and four face buttons.
    - LT: tap for an emergency dodge or lunge; hold to sprint, or take off in high-speed flight.
    - LB: hold for the defensive stance; a well-timed tap is a perfect block.
    - RB: tap to toggle between energy and physical combat.
    - RT: tap for a 360-degree energy burst; hold to channel qi or power, depending on the fighter.
    - LT and RT held together: the most powerful specials and signatures.
    - X light attack, Y heavy attack, B signature, A situational (protect, extract from or make an example of civilians; pick up a boulder, tree or makeshift weapon; grab and throw).
    - Every input combination should feed the director for intelligent, dynamic, fast-paced combat.
    - Orb asked for an analysis of the complications, the effect on the procedural move ceiling, and simplifications.

## Fight lanes and the camera (2026-10-01)
- Depth is handled entirely by the choreographer (ADR 0009). No depth nudge in the control scheme.
- Smashes, launches and throws all get a slight variation of angle, so back-and-forth fights zigzag slightly. Bigger deviations from the lane happen only when a building or another dynamic blocker is targeted.
- Orb on the prototypes: "it looked fantastic". Believable city blocks, cars, bikes and foot traffic follow from this; even the bare prototype looked more organic.
- Camera: "I really want the camera and cinematography to sell the impacts." Fighters seem a little too small, especially in the faster parts of a fight where the zoom extends out. Character cosmetics will look much better up close.

## Questionnaire 9 (2026-10-01): camera
- Fighter size on screen: 7 of 10 (clearly larger than today).
- Far apart or fast: zoom out, but never below a minimum fighter size.
- Selling impacts: a fast push-in to the point of contact, camera shake, and a chase camera behind the launched fighter.
- Cuts to another angle: big set pieces (finishers, transformations, world changes), plus crippling moments, building smashes and beam struggles.
- Camera angle in the lanes: not sure; show both (side-on and three-quarter) in the real game.
- A building between camera and fighter: a circular cut-away around the fighter.
- Player control: a zoom preference in settings (closer or wider).
- Shake and slow-motion intensity: 2 of 10 (subtle by default).
- Close-ups: the match intro, transformations, finishers and the knockout.
- Orb's notes: the camera sometimes doesn't catch up to the fighter; fighters are often launched out of the visible area faster than the camera follows; the camera often follows the launched fighter, so after knocking the opponent away Orb can't tell what their own character is doing.
- Not answered (options to pitch): what happens to control during a cinematic moment.

## Camera picks (2026-10-01)
- Cinematic moments: short ones run live; long set pieces pause the fight for both players. Orb wants ideas for the set pieces and the conditions that trigger a pause.
- Following a launch: the hybrid. The camera stays with the player's fighter when they launch the opponent, cuts briefly to the impact and returns; it chases when the player is the one launched; two players on one screen use the split.

## Questionnaire 10 (2026-10-01): remaining issues
- Set pieces that pause the fight for both players: transformation, a world-changing ability, and the planet giving way at 11:00. The others (finisher, knockout, crippling moment, beam struggle start, revealed signature, smash chains, landmarks) run live.
- Pause budget: about 2 seconds a minute.
- Transformation pace: fewer and later, about 3 a match, the first around 1:30.
- Upgrade draft: C, a pre-match plan that switches on by stage.
- Second city: 12% of the planet.
- Harbour and industrial districts: few civilians, mostly workers who evacuate fast.
- Mountains: a visible far row that beams can scar but fighters can't reach.
- Old laptops and phones: 30 frames a second with reduced effects is fine.
- Feedback reports: prefer a private route (email or a private form), not public issues.
- Babble voices: close, needs tweaks (Orb to say which).
- Priorities after the controls work: the agency fixes (counters on request, dodge-cancel, burst, perfect block), then combat variety (blasts, teleports, beam struggles).
- Speed blitzes: Orb wants "ping pong" blitzes to look great and "teleport spam" as a system, with efficient but non-direct flight paths. Example: a fighter knocks the opponent away at high speed, then blasts off even faster to arrive ahead and knock them back; the path there arcs like a golden-ratio spiral, not a straight line that would clip through the other fighter.
- Animation problems Orb saw: fighters sometimes face backwards; elbows bend the wrong way or arms stick straight out behind the body; in close exchanges one fighter passes through the other and both face opposite directions for a while. Orb wants more precision in selling punches: full contact on every hit.

## Teleports, transformation counts and the rival's balance (2026-10-01)
- Teleporting is on hold until there is a good reason to introduce it. Rule of cool may be reason enough, but Orb hasn't decided whether teleport should belong to one specific character as their signature ability. Blitzes use flight paths only for now.
- Transformations: about three per fighter is reasonable for a typical fighter. The Empress is the outlier: her excessive transformations are what make her unique and appealing.
- Balance picture, subject to a balance pitch and revisions: the Protagonist and the rival (the Anti-hero) are both solid all-rounders. The rival is skewed: his final transformation is the largest swing in power in the roster, but his unique ego mechanic may give him massive debuffs, or grant the opponent massive buffs, in the mid to late game.

## Questionnaire 11: rule of cool (2026-10-01)

Orb's picks.

- **Planet-scale launches:** orbit and re-entry; through the mountain; the ping-pong rally. Not picked: the round-the-world hit, the sea parted to the floor, dragged across the city.
- **Clashes beyond the beam struggle:** a fist clash shockwave; a blur exchange across the sky; a grapple lock in mid-air. Not picked: an aura standoff, catching a punch.
- **Answers to an incoming beam or blast:** swat it into the scenery; walk through it; split it around the body. Not picked: catch and throw it back, fly up the beam.
- **The world reacting as power rises:** clouds part and the sky changes; rubble floats upward; ground cracks spread when standing; windows blow out for blocks. Not picked: the sea pulling back, a storm.
- **Impacts at the biggest moments:** speed lines and panel cut-ins. Not picked: impact frames, slow motion.
- **Battle damage on fighters:** all five (torn clothing, scuffs and bruises, a broken limb hangs or drags, the aura flickers when worn, heavy breathing and stagger).
- **Story beats:** a crater-landing entrance; a staredown before the first blow; a mid-fight taunt that can be punished; the winner stands in the wreckage. Not picked: a last stand at the brink, a double knockout.
- **Bystanders and the world:** crowds watch and flee; throwable vehicles and ships. Not picked: a news helicopter, a useless military, the hero catching debris.
- **Top-tier finisher scale:** 7 of 10 (1 wrecks a block, 10 scars the planet).
- **How often the big spectacle happens:** 4 of 10 (1 rare and earned, 10 constant fireworks).
- **The aura after a transformation:** on only when charging or attacking.
- **Orb's note:** "quips, one liners, banter, taunts should all include a cut-in of the talking character's face on the side of the screen."

## Questionnaire 12: rule of cool, follow-up (2026-10-01)

- **Round-the-world hit:** yes after all, at the top power tiers only.
- **Orbit launch:** the game picks the most dramatic landing spot.
- **Scars:** land scars stay all match; water closes in seconds.
- **Clash input:** timed presses (hit the pulse to surge).
- **Answering a beam (swat, walk through, split):** costs tight timing only.
- **Battle damage on a transformation:** it stays and keeps building.
- **Move names:** the fighter shouts it; no name card.
- **Sound:** silence just before a huge hit; a fighter's theme kicks in on transformation; a delayed boom from far-off impacts.
- **Match end:** a highlight reel of the best moments.
- **The world reacts from:** tier 3.
- **Bystander tone:** 6 of 10 (1 grim, 10 comic relief).
- **Pitches requested:** which hits earn the big impact treatment; what a last stand at the brink gives the fighter; what a completed taunt does ("depends on fighter").

## Rule-of-cool pitch picks and the stacking rule (2026-10-01)

- **Impact treatment:** option B, two levels. Speed lines alone on every launch and landed heavy (a brief streak, no cut); the panel cut-in for the peaks (signatures, finishers, crippling blows, the KO) and for hits the player earned, sharing one panel per 12 s.
- **Last stand at the brink:** option B, one last signature: free and ready at once for 20 s, the first time a fighter reaches the brink, once per fighter per match.
- **Taunts:** "taunts should just feed meters" (option A, meter only), with the shared rules (punishable, the face cut-in).
- **Legal's stacking rule:** accepted. No single moment shows more than two of the seven power-up marks; the charging aura is a thin outline in our own shapes.

## Orb's direction, 2026-10-01 (before a four to five hour absence)

- **Top priority:** controller support and local two-player versus, testable on the live build when Orb returns.
- **Animation is no longer "lean".** Orb: "When we selected the 'lean' minimal options for character animations and movesets I was beset by some doubts that have since been rectified. I want you to work towards an optimistic overhaul of the current animation system: try to maximize the dynamic animations, overhaul our ragdolls, fine tune the physics model." Extra polish work goes to animation.
- **Faces:** "loop on the art style to create stylized closeups of the fighters' faces so the on-screen closeups can be memorable and recognizable."
- **Voice:** "get the voice line packet ready for me to edit so we can start working on the tone and style standards for our characters going forward."
- Orb asked for an ETA on the depth axis (fight lanes) work.
- The EP is to keep working through the absence with the permissions it has.

## Orb's direction on return, 2026-10-01 (evening)

- **Art direction.** "the mask aesthetic, broken masks should be part of an upcoming character, not the game's overall art style." The masks are parked as a seed for a future fighter. Orb likes the fighters' faces, and the silhouettes "kind of grew on me"; both are to be refined. The Cyborg is "the least compelling of the launch fighters", so the refinement starts with him. Orb wants to dig into this on return.
- **Animation and rigging.** "in many of the stills and gifs of the fighters, I see lots of limbs bent unnaturally, knees bending the wrong way during kicks, elbows turning inward." If it would carry over to the launch fighters "it needs to be quashed immediately". Animation's brief: joint limits enforced at the root, a lint over every pose and live matches, and a rule for new rigs (docs/animation/joint-limits.md).
- **Pause.** Orb is reviewing the backlog; work is brought to a resting place. The list of everything waiting for Orb is docs/ep/orb-review-list.md. Orb wants to revisit the sound profiles.

## Orb's first two-player playtest, 2026-10-02

Two local matches with a second player. "good first impressions". Direction, in Orb's words where quoted:

1. **Control against the director.** "lets continue to tune the amount of control the director grants the player. the worst is how pressing a single attack key at any distance essentially locks both fighters from performing actions as the attacker flies in and performs the attack." Orb wants a list of solutions. Orb's own idea: attack buttons act as taunts from range; one press plays a taunt, holding the attack through the taunt ends it by taking off at max speed to attack.
2. **Brawls against launches.** Only one knockback slide in two fights; "every brawl seems to end in a launch". Combo trading should be more represented and flashy; air juggling and pinballing slightly less common but with higher payoff and spectacle.
3. **Air recovery.** "Players need a way to air recover from knockbacks."
4. **Craters and terrain destruction from slides and tumbling** are to be "a central feature of the game". Craters and bounce-and-crater impacts "look great". To consult on: an impact hard enough for an extremely large crater should leave the fighter in it, with no bounce out.
5. **Mountain tumbles** were "kind of funny but also just a little off": too much momentum gained from a seemingly low-impact glancing bounce.
6. **RB.** Perhaps hold RB to fire energy attacks, in place of the toggle.
7. **Beams.** The cooldown "felt too restrictive, feels like a relic from the prototype". Bring energy combat into fights, more ways to beam struggle, more forgiving timing to dodge and block beams. Looking forward to walking through beams and beams splitting.
8. **The combo system: a "fight alchemist".** Orb likes the choreographer but does not want agency removed. Tilting the stick during a fight or a juggle controls the relative screen direction the opponent is launched. Button presses are ingredients in the ongoing string, not a queue: the alchemist reads the last few presses of both fighters (three, as an example), compares each player's running mix of attack types with their latest presses, and builds a choreographed sequence the player would expect. It must be "clear and standardized": light-heavy play gives a rapid blur of strikes; kiting is dodges, a few heavy blows to knock away, and energy blasts from range. Holding, mashing and tapping in time with the blows on screen should each give different results.
9. **LT and escape.** Escape tied to a direction and holding the trigger "was a little strange". Players should fly at high speed at will, with a mechanic to stop the other escaping and a way for the escaper to exit any situation at some risk.
10. **Split-screen camera.** It jolted left and right in some cases, such as when a player was knocked away. A pass on the camera.

Orb asked for all directors to be briefed, iteration to start, and a questionnaire to nail down direction (questionnaire 14).

### Questionnaire 14: player agency (Orb, 2026-10-02)

- **Ranged press:** Other. "pitch some hybrid systems, give control to players but avoid a nightmare scenario of two fighters standing in opposite corners whiffing jabs in the air with zero purpose. standing far apart and spamming taunts is the minimum acceptable, especially if there are reactive voice-lines, bonus points if those lines keep feeling fresh even if they spent all day." (EP pitches hybrids.)
- **Ranged taunt effects:** a voice line with a face cut-in (the only one picked; not "punishable", not "held launch hits harder", not "cancel with a dodge"; "feeds meters" was not picked here, though the earlier ruling was "taunts should just feed meters").
- **Alchemist input reading:** Other. "pitch me some hybrids between 'three clear styles' and 'timing is the skill'". (EP pitches.)
- **Alchemist window:** 5 presses.
- **Recipe display:** an option in settings.
- **Launch direction:** the stick picks, the director snaps to the most dramatic nearby target.
- **Launch share:** 30% of brawls end in a launch.
- **What earns a launch:** a charged or held heavy; the ender of a full string; heavy plus a stick direction; winning a clash. (Not a guard break or riposte; not spending meter.)
- **Air recovery:** hold to brake, costs ki; harder hits take longer.
- **Energy input:** hold RB; the attack buttons become blasts and beams.
- **Beam limit:** the pills were left blank; the slider says 15 s between signatures (was 120).
- **Beam plays wanted:** all eight: both fire at once; fire late into an incoming beam; block then push back; walk through on guard; split the beam; swat it away; blast volleys that trade; feeding a struggle with a second charge.
- **Beam defence forgiveness:** 3 of 5.
- **Flight:** hold LT to boost in any direction, draining ki.
- **Escape:** the pursuer boosts and strikes to catch; blasts from behind knock the escaper down; intercept by appearing ahead, at a ki cost; empty ki leaves the escaper exhausted. (Not picked: extra damage from behind; paying to break out of a brawl.)
- **Hard impacts:** yes, the fighter is buried in the huge crater, and the attacker gets a free follow-up.
- **Slide and tumble destruction:** 4 of 5.
- **Notes:** "the fights are cool, the craters blowing up from transformations and beam explosions look really cool, fighters almost get a little too fast when max transformation is reached".

### Orb's picks after the pitches (2026-10-02)

1. **Ranged press:** the EP's mix. Three range bands (close strikes, mid is a short lunge decided at the wind-up, far is tap to taunt and hold to charge); the taunt is a challenge the opponent can answer by pressing attack, so both rush and meet in a clash or blur; the button picks the charge (a held light is fast and can be feinted, a held heavy is slower, shrugs off blasts and can earn a launch). A strike never exists at range.
2. **Reading presses:** timing upgrades each style (a steady mash becomes a perfect blur, a hold released on the flash breaks guard, taps in time land clean), and timing earns the ending. Orb's reference is a well-known scene of two fighters trading stomach punches in turn: two players both hitting the timing on their power attacks should produce that. "lets run balance tests on your recommendation, consistent timing should give the fighter a substantial edge".
3. **Taunts feed meters,** probably ("not 100% sure but i think it would be a good thing"); voice lines and face cut-ins "at the very least". Working ruling: they feed, with a guard against farming; revisit in play.
4. **Beams:** no final calls yet. "I just didn't like the cooldown, I want the energy combat system to be implemented before I make any more decisions on energy beams, I want to personally experience how the expansion of ranged blasts change the gameplay". Build energy and ranged combat first; the signature limit stays provisional.
5. **Escape control:** "I need to feel how this works in game... lets get something that works now and then work on it when we have more combat systems in place". Build a provisional version.
6. **Top-tier speed:** no yes or no. Instead: "think of how many more ways there are to visually communicate more intense powers and higher strength levels. rocks levitating around a powered-up individual look cool".

### Orb on the energy blasts, 2026-10-02 (after watching AI matches)

"i like the new energy blasts". Wanted: blasts "erupt into flame and smoke, explosive particles"; "deflecting energy attacks shouldn't reflect back at the opponent but deflect them off in a random direction with a payoff of seeing it hit the ground elsewhere and explode." Orb asked for a mock-up animation before anything goes into the build; the EP showed one in chat. Not briefed for building until Orb confirms the mock-up.

Orb, after the mock-up (2026-10-02): "charged shots should have the capability of damaging, possibly leveling a building. with enough of a barrage smaller shots should eventually do damage. rapidly spamming small energy blasts should lose some accuracy, but follow rule of cool logic and make sure the energy blasts are sprayed in a cone at the enemy fighter. lets get a variety of energy attacks that are possible, like leaving a hovering energy blast mine that the enemy could walk into, with enough ki a fighter could leave a minefield either on the ground or in the air". The EP takes the flame-and-smoke eruptions and the random-direction deflect as wanted (Orb built on the mock-up without objecting); explosion size per shot kind is still Orb's to tune in play. This overrides Game Design's §14.6 line that bolts never damage structures.

## The next big update, and a pause (Orb, 2026-10-02)

"I want the next big update to include the expanded energy blasts, two fighters (protagonist and rival, I will have names for these two and the vocabulary text work you need me to do soon) and the framework for the combat alchemy layer tied into the fight choreographer. I want some peace and quiet for gaming, so please bring all ongoing work to a pause and we'll get ready for the big update soon."

Scope of the next update: (1) expanded energy blasts (agency-pass sections 15 and 16: wild deflects, the spray cone, shots against buildings, mines, more kinds); (2) two fighters, the Protagonist and the rival (the Anti-hero), replacing the KAI and VORR placeholders; Orb supplies their names and edits the voice packet; (3) the framework of the combat alchemy layer in the director (the press window, styles, timing grades, flow). All sessions pause until Orb says go.

Orb, 2026-10-02: "the rival character should have glasses, i want him to be our resident 'scary shiny glasses' trope character". The rival (the Anti-hero) wears glasses whose lenses go opaque with glare at key moments.

## Orb, 2026-10-04: intros, backstory, music

Verbatim:

> I thought the intros looked pretty good, if we can script a system that creates dynamic intros and mixes and matches different scenarios between characters I'd like to see it. I'm thinking about a document defining the backstory so we can flesh out the power system a little more thoroughly. I listened to the music, I feel like they were al a little bit too "spooky" or almost like a "halloween" atmosphere; sketch-a-town-band had the most interesting hook. I have a premium Suno Account, so if you include a Suno 6.0-ready prompt along with the sound samples to direct the Suno model we can really zero in on a coherent sound. I want to lean a little more into a tongue-in-cheek riff-heavy speed metal version of what you gave me already. Direct "Audio & Music" to work with the expectation that Suno will create the final product, and I can feed the final music files back to you.

What follows from it:

- Intros: Orb likes them and wants a system that composes them from mix-and-match scenarios per pair of fighters (Narrative: docs/narrative/dynamic-intros.md; Encounter owns the intro phase).
- Backstory: a document defining the backstory, so the power system can be fleshed out (Narrative drafts a skeleton of options; Orb fills it).
- Music: the previews read too spooky; sketch-a-town-band has the best hook; the direction is tongue-in-cheek, riff-heavy speed metal. Suno (Orb's premium account) makes the final music from our prompts and reference samples, and Orb feeds the files back (Audio: docs/audio/suno-direction.md).

## Orb, 2026-10-04: questionnaire 15 (pending decisions)

Answers as given:

- Front-row buildings: Other: "hybrid of 2 + 3, pavement should crack and shatter differently from dirt, can windows shatter + multiple levels of dynamic destruction per building" (2 = cut top-tier reach into buildings, 3 = soften landing blasts).
- Extra blast kinds: Splitting shot (rival) only. Rain hits its thrower: No (rain is not in this update).
- Glasses frame: C, the bare wedge. Glare hides his eyes: yes, fully hidden.
- Protagonist look: approve. Rival look: approve.
- Deflected shot's landing ring: make the landing a surprise.
- Split-screen rush jolt: this update.
- Beat-pace loophole in the perfect blur: build the fix.
- Finisher struggle strictness: 2 of 3 (between lenient and the strict rule that was live).
- Backstory: "Interview me with a questionnaire".
- Not answered: how hard medium should be against good timing; the fighters' names; whether to run the split on neutral ids.

Notes, verbatim:

> timing should land clean, instant-looking blows with an after-image, mashing should fire attacks, impact landing on-trigger so they look fast and leave a fluid afterimage blur, holding should be the most fluid looking and account for power hits, use warping or smear effects to illustrate the speed and power of these attacks, right now my feeling on combat is that there is a lot of small downtime breaks, I just played (about ten minutes ago) against Vorr and it seems like they will trade around three to five blows, the AI will slip away in some kind of looping pattern, then I'll catch up to him, and repeat. sometimes it will end up in a launch which looks cool, the speed and acceleration of launches can be tuned to accommodate the viewer,  the 'combat lunges' should be a bit more controllable and easier to spot when they're being used against you, right now an opponent flying from very far away at max speed is very hard to judge, the split screen needs tuning so it is easier to track combat.
>
> I would like a prototype animation of the three melee types, mashing, timed and holding, so I know we're on the same page.

## Orb, 2026-10-04: the melee feel (after the second prototype)

The approved reference is docs/ep/prototypes/melee-trade-v2.html (open it in a browser). Orb asked for it to let both fighters be set to speed, tech, heavy, combo or block and trade blows at once; a heavy knocks back only as a combo ender; a combo is 3, 4 or 5 hits where only the last is a heavy; a blocker is never knocked back; the tech after-image differs from the speed blur.

Verbatim:

> that second prototype looks a lot like what I want the combat to feel like. close up brawls should make fighters slightly 'magnetic' so they can trade continuous strings of blows without interruption. both players should feel like their attacks actually match a button press. mashers should see their fighter landing faster flurries the quicker they tap the attack, a player trying to tech timing combos should see his character landing flashy skill attacks that lapse into high speed flurries when they miss their timing, and the heavy attack should be reliable against a heavy guard opponent, or to set up chains of skillful juggle attacks.

What follows from it:

- Close brawls are slightly magnetic: fighters stay in range and trade continuous strings without the fight breaking apart.
- Every attack on screen matches a button press, for both players.
- Mashing: the faster the taps, the faster the flurry.
- Timing: on-beat presses give flashy skill attacks; a missed beat lapses into a high-speed flurry, not a dead press.
- Heavy: reliable against a heavily guarding opponent, and the set-up for chains of skilful juggle attacks.
- This moves melee from "the director composes the exchange" toward "each press is a blow"; the director still owns the choreography of what each blow is.

## Orb, 2026-10-04: stances stay, and every stance has a moveset

Verbatim:

> stances will still be involved, the default represents the characters' martial arts stance, LB represents defensive stance, RB is Energy arts stance, RT is the charging stance, LT is maneuver stance. All face buttons should have an appropriately broad moveset for each stance. Lets work out a way to generatively work all these stances into vast and varied movesets for each character.

What follows from it:

- Five stances, chosen by what is held: none = the fighter's martial arts stance; LB = defensive; RB = energy arts; RT = charging; LT = manoeuvre.
- Every face button does something in every stance, with a broad moveset per stance.
- The movesets are to be generated: a system that composes large, varied movesets for each character from parts, not hand-written lists.
- Pillar 2 ("stances, not combos") keeps its stances; what a press does inside a stance is now a blow or an action of that stance.

## Orb, 2026-10-04: stance questionnaire delegated to the EP

Verbatim: "I want you to answer this questionnaire in my stead. I had a conversation with controls & game feel and I feel you're suited to take over this task."

What Orb confirmed to Controls directly (as Controls records it in docs/controls/stance-questionnaire.md): RT dominates; hybrids LT+RB (evasive energy), LB+RB (defensive ki) and LT+LB (terrain while flying); the AI can do anything the player can; simplified and accessibility controls let a player hand stance choices to the choreographer at any granularity; B gives every fighter its own array of signatures; struggles affect all fighters.

The EP's answers, which Orb can overrule: docs/ep/stance-answers-2026-10-04.md.

## Orb, 2026-10-05: questionnaire 17 (melee and stances)

Answers as given:

- A lone heavy: "A fully held heavy may also launch" (so the string's ender and a fully held heavy both launch; a tapped lone heavy does not).
- A mashed string closes with a stagger in place, so the brawl stays together.
- After a knock-back the re-close is always the player's own move (no automatic pull).
- The beat is shown on the body, plus an optional beat ring in settings.
- The five signature kinds: "I'd like to hear more on this, it looks good I just want some quick charts and alternatives before this is finalized".
- The 75 ki ultimate: only in the last two acts.
- New small actions: all three (check with a parry when timed after a block, push, step strike).
- The stick leans which limb he strikes with: yes.
- Identity split (Protagonist: palms, blade hands, arcs; rival: fists, plates, straight lines): yes.
- The rival's hands: a mix, fists on heavies and blade hands on lights.
- The rival's glasses: always on.
- A juggle: up to 5 skill strikes.
- Go-aheads ticked: build the dynamic intros first cut (three scenarios); a far charge becomes a slower visible pursuit, not a taunt-only ceiling. Not ticked: the audio encoder install; the fighter split on neutral ids.

Notes, verbatim:

> just played the latest update. we've got some work to do but the combat is getting to a good place. we're aiming for snappy combos, attack trades that look pre-planned, variety of attacks. I like the thought that holding LT creates mid-range lunging attacks, these can be utilized at great cost to stamina, can I see a version of the latest combo prototype specifically showcasing the face buttons combined with LT? I want to see the lunging behavior. in the game I would expect every stance to be able to connect blows against a player using this, but the character should zip back and forth in a stylistic blur, matching our visual cues we established for speed, tech and heavy.

## Orb, 2026-10-05: modifiers on every button, and the LT zip

Verbatim:

> in all states X, Y, B all should have speed, tech, heavy modifiers. A should have a press and a hold, no grab spamming. LT plus an attack should cause the fighter to zip to the opponent to land the strike and zip back by default. LT plus an attack plus the movement stick pushed towards the opponent should zip to the opponent, land the strike, then zip the fighter on the other side of the opponent. please update a new prototype animation so we can see different permutations of this playing out. well timed heavy and tech strikes should be able to counter this,

What follows from it:

- In every stance X, Y and B each read three ways: speed (mashed), tech (timed), heavy (held).
- A has a press and a hold. Grabs cannot be spammed.
- LT + an attack: zip to the opponent, land the strike, zip back. That is the default.
- LT + an attack + the stick toward the opponent: zip in, land the strike, then zip through to the opponent's other side.
- A well-timed heavy or tech strike from the defender counters a zip.

## Orb, 2026-10-05: build the zip; any spot around the enemy

The approved reference is docs/ep/prototypes/lt-zip-v4.html.

Verbatim:

> the zip prototype looks right, start building it. consider how players should be able to use it to end up in any spot in a 360 degree around the enemy, and if they use it and are holding a direction away from the opponent, they end further from where they started and this is a useful way to escape from a brawl you aren't ready to commit to.

What follows from it:

- The zip is approved for building.
- The stick chooses where he ends up: any spot on a full circle around the enemy (above, below, behind, in front), not only "back" or "the far side".
- Holding away from the opponent ends him further out than where he started: the zip is also a way to leave a brawl he is not ready to commit to.

## Orb, 2026-10-05: leave headroom on building destruction

Verbatim:

> we're still adding energy blasts and more special moves, so if we're underperforming on building destruction now, that's a good thing, because potentially we'll be seeing more vast swathes of destructive abilities when more energy specials and signatures are created

What follows from it: building loss should sit below its ceiling for now, leaving room for the signatures, specials and blast kinds still to come. The EP's ruling: apply both the hybrid (less top-tier reach, slightly softer landings) and the stage cap (a blast leaves a wreck), which World measured at about 38 to 40% of the front row lost, inside the 25 to 50 band.

## Orb, 2026-10-05: a roster of twelve; "an imaginary anime's fourth season"

Verbatim:

> I plan to finish the lists you wanted me working on by this time tomorrow. I'm going to sleep so I want you working full steam on this project. I want some generic templates to consider for fighter niches we haven't touched yet so I can start working on the full roster of characters I want to see. I want to lay the groundwork for a full roster of twelve, so classify the roles and subroles we've already established with our first four in our roster, then give me notes and proposals for fighters who can fill out the rest. ((Spitballing: rough ideas ahead but hopefully, with the list of taunts, quotes etc that I hand back tomorrow evening, we'll be able to fully flesh out an implied history , backstories, previous adventures etc. to create the feeling of a game based on an imaginary anime's fourth season. I am currently working on a distinct original universe that will justify the abilities these characters have.))

What follows from it:

- The roster target is twelve fighters (it was four). The first four are the Protagonist, the rival (the Anti-hero), the Empress and the Cyborg.
- Wanted now: the roles and subroles the first four establish, generic templates for niches not yet touched, and notes and proposals for the other eight.
- The framing for the fiction: the game should feel like it is based on an imaginary anime's fourth season, with an implied history, backstories and earlier adventures. Orb is writing an original universe that justifies the fighters' abilities, and hands back the taunt and quote lists on the evening of 2026-10-06.
- Orb is asleep for the night and wants work to continue at full pace.

## Orb, 2026-10-05: questionnaire 18 (overnight)

Answers as given:

- Roster niches to explore: stealth or ambush, heavy or giant, speedster, terrain shaper.
- Alignment split: hero-heavy, an ensemble of allies.
- Body variety: 2 of 5 (close to all humanoid; small departures such as tails or size).
- Signatures: the defensive (LB) and manoeuvre (LT) signatures differ per fighter.
- The tech zip as a fast drawn dash: accepted.
- Zip strike price: 20 ki.
- Zip away: a reliable escape at a higher ki price.
- Medium AI against a well-timed player: toughen medium against combos.
- Intros: allow the longer ones; who lands first: random each match.
- HUD: the rival's stance badge always shown; a beat ring for the rival's blows too. (Not chosen: an in-fight move legend; a marker when the player's own fighter leaves the pane.)
- Move names: Narrative drafts, Orb edits in the voice lab.
- Overnight machine use approved: QA's long measurement batches; the fighter rename on neutral ids (Protagonist, Rival). Not approved: the audio encoder install.
- Next priority when the queue is done: the other four stances' movesets.

Notes, verbatim:

> "Legal wants the tech zip drawn as a very fast dash (4 to 5 ticks) and not a true blink. Accept?"
>
> how can we keep the mechanics on the tech zip consistent with our other tech hits across the board? go with your best judgment
>
> "Dynamic intros: the Latecomer and the Long Look run 7 to 7.6 seconds (today's is 5, all skippable). And who lands first?"
>
> P1 then P2 is pretty standard, as long as the dynamic intros can create many distinct implied plotlines between each character I'd like to see these handled as generatively as possible.

The EP's judgment on the tech question, as delegated: "tech" means the same three things everywhere. The strike pose lands on the contact tick with no in-between; the after-image is sharp wire echoes that trail the body and pop off back to front; the contact mark is the hard diamond. Travel is never part of it: a tech zip crosses as the fastest drawn dash the rules allow and then lands its strike exactly like any other tech hit.

## 2026-10-05, morning: ideas for special attacks

Orb: "give me the morning summary. ove the next few days I want to start spitballing ideas for special attacks, energy blasts etc. so get a template ready so I can put my ideas in"

The EP's sheet for it: docs/ep/ideas/special-moves.md. It is Orb's file; nobody else edits it.

## 2026-10-05: going to market

Orb asked for "a consult on advertising, where I can get this game listed, and realistic sales expectations. this is a hobby vibe-coded game with a shoestring budget, so I don't expect a miracle, give it to me straight about what I'm up against." Orb wants to "temper my expectations and coordinate a plan to get engagement that translates into real sales", asks "What console stores can I realistically get listed on?", and notes: "by word of mouth a lot of my friends who have Playstations show excitement for this project."

After the EP's consult, Orb: "go, brief Marketing, Legal and Platform for the written plan. upfront AI disclosure is the only ethical path to take for this project."

Standing rule from this: the project discloses its AI-made content upfront, everywhere it is presented or sold. Nothing is ever described as human-made that is not.
