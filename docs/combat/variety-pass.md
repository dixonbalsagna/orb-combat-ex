# Variety pass

Owner: Combat and Choreography. Implementation: Encounter Systems. Numbers: Game Design. Date: 2026-09-30. Status: design, with data in `data/combat/styles.json` (not read by the sim until Encounter's style slice). Section 9 lists what the control scheme in ADR 0008 changes. The pulse clashes (fist clash, blur exchange, grapple lock), the ping-pong's pieces and the three beam answers are in `m0-rich.md` sections 6 to 8. Folds in Game Design's Q4 redesign (`stance-matrix.md` R4, R5 and R9; `spec-wounds.md` sections 1 and 9) and Encounter's Q4 plan (`docs/director/q4-director-control-plan.md`).

**Orb** (`docs/ep/vision.md`, questionnaire 4): "I liked the faster fight pace. Now I want to see cleaner combos, more teleport clashing, stylistic flying combat, heavy ground combat, energy blasts, more varied beam struggles."

**The control split** (questionnaire 4, pillar 2):
- **The player chooses:** stance, movement, attack weight (light, heavy or signature, queued), charging, transformations and specials.
- **The director chooses:** *when* to attack, the combo, the tactics and every timing outcome. Parry and the finisher struggle are no longer player presses; Game Design is redesigning them as director rolls.

This pass is written for that split. The player's intent picks the template and its outcome (`stance-matrix.md`, `exchange-templates.md`); the director picks *how it looks*.

---

## 1. The shape of the change: styles over outcomes

**Templates stay the judge.** Stance × attack kind × defender state picks the template, and its selector picks the branch: who wins, what is decisive, which windows open. Nothing in this pass changes an outcome, a tag or a selector's draws.

**A style is the choreography chosen for that outcome.** After the branch is chosen, the director scores the styles whose gates pass (section 3) and applies one. A style is a small **overlay** on the branch's `dynamic` beats:

| Slot | What a style can change | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `approach` | the first rush: its path (straight, arc, along the ground, a blink) | aerial: an arcing dive; blink: vanish and reappear |
| `contacts` | every strike: extra `o` flags and a cue | ground: double knockback with a skid cue |
| `between` | beats inserted between contacts | aerial: a swoop to the other side; blink: a vanish-reappear |
| `decider` | the strike just before the branch's launch | ground: a stomp that dents the ground |
| `prelude` | beats that replace everything between the approach and the decider; later beats shift to fit | blink clash: three mid-air meets before the decisive one |
| `launch` | a hint to the launch planner (Encounter scores it) | ground: a short slam or a throw along the ground |
| `pursuit` | the chase after the launch | aerial: a cross-sky arc |

Each style is the same small set of authored parts, reused across every template it applies to. That is procedural-moves stage 2 in practice: styles are the first generative slot, and parts are still authored.

---

## 2. The six asks

### 2.1 Cleaner combos
**The problem today.** Every chain link is the same shape (a 0.24 s rush, a strike, a launch, a window), at a random cadence: the AI presses 0.12 to 0.35 s into the window. A long chain reads as launch, catch, launch: mush.

**The design: a chain is a phrase.** It has an opener, links on a fixed beat, and one ender.
- **Decided by the director at each window** (R9, Encounter's Q4 plan). One draw against `chainP` replaces the attacker's press. `chainP` comes from the stance and the mood band (`styles.json` `chains.chainP`):
  - AGGRESSIVE: Calm 0.55, Tense 0.7, Frenzied 0.85;
  - DEFENSIVE: 0.25, 0.35, 0.5;
  - EVASIVE: 0.3, 0.45, 0.55;
  - ESCAPE never chains (R2 hit and run).

  Then −0.15 per link already landed, +0.1 at the Protagonist's Boiling heat, and zero under 6 ki.
- **A blitz is a fast chain.** Chosen at the first window in Tense or Frenzied (25% or 50%, +10% per act above 1): at least 3 links at a 10-tick gap. Game Design tunes it toward 2 to 6 blitzes a minute.
- **A fixed rhythm.** Links land 18 ticks (0.3 s) apart, so the player hears and sees the count.
- **Distinct links.** Each link's strike cycles a shape cue (`link_knee`, `link_elbow`, `link_kick`), so no two consecutive links look alike. Styles can swap the pursuit, for example an aerial *relay* that overtakes the flying body and strikes back.
- **One ender.** When the draw says stop, or the cap is next, the director plays the ender instead of a link: a heavier strike (`chainStrike` with `ender`), a long-only launch (`breakLaunch`), the `chain_ender` cue and the CHAIN ×N banner (Narrative's label). Links only juggle (a small pop), and only the ender sends the body away. Every chain ends on a clear full stop.

### 2.2 Teleport clashes (held)
**Held (Orb, 2026-10-01).** Teleporting is on hold until there is a good reason to introduce it, and it may become one character's signature ability. Nothing in this section is built or switched on. It is kept as the design to return to. In the data the `blink_clash` style has weight 0.

**The blink clash:** a style for HEAVY CLASH and aerial TRADE BLOWS.
- **Heavy clash.** Both fighters vanish from the approach and reappear meeting in mid-air. Fists and forearms meet (`blink_meet`: a spark, no damage), they vanish again and reappear at a new angle (above, behind, below). After three meets, the decisive meet plays the branch's outcome: WON, COUNTERED or SHOCKWAVE.
- **Trade blows.** Each of the four exchanged blows lands at a new blink position (a vanish-reappear trade), then the fighters meet for the decider.
- **Every blink shows the air-ripple tell** at departure and arrival (`blink_out`, `blink_in`). It is canon for the Protagonist and is kept for everyone, so blinks always read.
- **Gates:** both fighters airborne (low or high air), and not underwater. **Weights:** higher when both are AGGRESSIVE, when the mood is heated, and for fighters with the `blink` trait (the Protagonist; the KAI placeholder has it).

### 2.3 Flying combat style
**Aerial:** a style for every melee template when both fighters are airborne.
- **Approach:** an arcing dive (`rush` with `arc`), coming in from above when the attacker is higher.
- **Between contacts:** a swoop to the far side or above (`rush` with an arc and a vertical offset), so blows come from new angles.
- **Decider:** a dive strike (`dive` cue).
- **Launch hint:** across or up.
- **Pursuit:** a cross-sky arc (0.5 s, a high arc) instead of the straight chase. In chains, the *relay*.

### 2.4 Heavy ground combat
**Ground brawl:** a style for every melee template when both fighters are on the ground (within 140 u of the surface) and over land.
- **Approach:** a skid along the ground (`rush` with `ground`), raising dust.
- **Contacts:** double knockback, so the struck fighter slides (World's knockback slides) with a `skid` cue.
- **Decider:** a stomp or ground slam that dents the ground (`o.crater`, small: World's crater rules keep big craters for special blows).
- **Launch hint:** a short slam into the ground, or a throw along it (slide and bounce).
- **Pursuit:** a ground dash.
- **Weights:** higher for heavy attacks, DEFENSIVE defenders (the guard shoves into slides), and fighters with the `brawler` trait.

### 2.5 Energy blasts
Small ki volleys between beams. Three uses:
- **Volley opener.** When the gap is over 1,200 u, the attacker fires 3 blasts during the approach instead of a silent pursuit flight. The approach still closes (pillar 3); the blasts land or are shrugged off as the defender's stance allows.
- **Barrage.** A style for PRESSURE (light against DEFENSIVE): the pressure string becomes a barrage of 5 blasts into the raised guard, then the guard shove.
- **Contemptuous poke.** When a fighter with the `volley` trait is in a cocky or contemptuous mood, a light at range becomes a volley-only exchange. This is the Anti-hero's style: barrage until the foe submits. Its volume scales with Pride once meters are in the roster data.

**Resolution follows the branch.** Blasts land on an attacker-favoured branch, are guarded (stance multiplier) on DEFENSIVE, and are evaded (a sidestep afterimage, no damage) on an EVASIVE win.
- **In the sim**, a blast is a scheduled impact: its arrival tick plus a strike. The projectile is render-only (an fx event with origin, target and travel ticks), so there are no new sim entities.
- **Blasts that miss** strike near the target's feet, with the ordinary area damage.

### 2.6 More varied beam struggles
The beam clash gets six shapes. The shape comes from the **margin** between the two clash scores the code already draws, plus context. There are no new draws.

| Shape | When | What happens | Favours |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Breakthrough** | margin 20 or more | the weaker beam fails fast: a 0.8 s overpower | winner |
| **Overpower** (today's) | margin 10 to 20 | the push drifts steadily to the loser; the winner's beam drives through | winner |
| **Seesaw** | margin 4 to 10, or a heated mood | the push swings back twice before resolving, over 2.4 s | winner |
| **Deflect** | margin 6 or more, the winner airborne | the winner angles away and deflects the loser's beam: skyward for a carer (`care` above 0), into the nearest settlement for a villain. The deflected beam carves where it goes; the loser is pushed back and pays ki, with no big hit | winner |
| **Split** | margin under 4, the meeting point within 300 u of the ground | the beams bend around each other and carve twin trenches to either side (Orb's friend: "love when they carve a trench"); chip damage to both | neutral |
| **Mutual blast** | margin under 4, in the air | the meeting point detonates: both fighters are launched apart and take damage; a crater if it is low | neutral |

When several shapes qualify, the first in this priority order wins: breakthrough, then deflect, split or mutual blast (by position), then seesaw, then overpower. The `game.clash` render state gains the shape and its keyframes (reversal times, the split angle), so Rendering and VFX can draw each shape.

## 3. Context selectors

| Selector | Source | Used by |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Altitude band** (both fighters) | submerged (over the sea, y below −60); ground (under 140 above the surface); low air (140 to 600); high air (600 and up) | aerial and blink need both fighters airborne; ground needs both on the ground over land; split needs the meeting point low |
| **Terrain and biome** | land or sea under each fighter; structures in range; slopes | ground brawl only on land; ground throws toward structures (World's brunts) |
| **Stance** | the attacker's and the defender's stance at exchange start (frozen, as for damage) | blink weight (both AGGRESSIVE); ground weight (a DEFENSIVE defender); barrage (light against DEFENSIVE) |
| **Mood** | Game Design's fight mood (`spec-wounds.md` section 9), a director value 0 to 100: Calm below 30, Tense 30 to 70, Frenzied above 70 | `chainP`; blitz chance; blink-clash weight (×1.5 Tense, ×2.5 Frenzied); seesaw beam shapes (Frenzied); "more blitzes when heated" (Orb) |
| **Act** | 1 + region breaks + transformations, capped at 4 (`spec-wounds.md` section 9) | raises blitz, blink-clash, long-launch and beam-struggle weights (+0.3 per act on blink clashes; long shapes favoured from act 3) |
| **Attack weight** (queued by the player) | light, heavy, signature | ground favours heavy; volleys favour light at range; signatures lead to beam shapes |
| **Distance** | the shortest-arc gap at the request | volley opener over 1,200 u; pursuit flights over 2,500 u |
| **Fighter traits** (roster data, D1) | `blink`, `volley`, `brawler`, `aerial` | weights: the Protagonist blinks; the Anti-hero and the Empress volley; the Cyborg brawls |

**How a style is picked:**
1. Filter the styles by their gates.
2. Multiply each weight by its matching factors.
3. Make one draw from the composition stream (`procedural-moves.md` section 10: keyed by seed, exchange and slot, so adding a style changes only the exchanges it could apply to).
4. If no style passes, play the plain `dynamic` beats.

---

## 4. Cues for Rendering and VFX
These are new names in the cue vocabulary (`data/combat/finishers.json` `cues`). The render and audio consumers map them to poses and effects. They are render-only: the sim just emits them.

**Telegraphs** (players now play by reads, R9):
- **The attacker's weight** shows through every approach: `tell_light` or `tell_heavy`, driven by the existing `attack` fx event, which carries the kind. Every template's approach starts at tick 0, so no data beat is needed.
- **The finisher's kind** shows in its wind-up: `finisher_tell_launch`, `_melee` or `_beam`, driven by `finisher_start.kind` (Encounter adds it from each finisher's `kind`).
- **The struggle's three pulses** show `struggle_hold` or `struggle_slip`.
- **A director parry** (R5) keeps its wind-up tell and flash.

| Cue | Look (for Rendering, VFX and Audio to design) | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| `tell_light`, `tell_heavy` | the attacker's weight, shown through the approach | 1 |
| `finisher_tell_launch`, `finisher_tell_melee`, `finisher_tell_beam` | the finisher's kind in its wind-up | 1 |
| `struggle_hold`, `struggle_slip` | the three pulses of the struggle | 1 |
| `blink_out`, `blink_in` | the air ripple at departure and arrival, and a short afterimage | 1 |
| `blink_meet` | two fighters snapping together in mid-air; a fist and forearm spark | 1 |
| `chain_ender` | the chain's full stop: a heavier impact flash, the CHAIN ×N banner | 1 |
| `clash_seesaw`, `clash_split`, `clash_deflect`, `clash_mutual`, `clash_breakthrough` | the beam-struggle shapes (drawn from `game.clash.shape` and its keyframes) | 1 |
| `volley_fire`, `blast_hit`, `blast_guard`, `blast_evade` | small energy bolts: muzzle flash, impact puff, a swatted-away spark, a sidestep afterimage | 2 |
| `barrage` | the volley's sustained stance (arm or arms firing), for barrage and poke | 2 |
| `dive`, `swoop` | aerial poses: a head-down dive, a banking swoop with a trail | 2 |
| `skid`, `stomp`, `ground_slam`, `ground_throw` | ground poses: dust skid, a stamping foot, a two-handed slam, a hip throw | 2 |
| `link_knee`, `link_elbow`, `link_kick` | chain-link strike shapes (distinct silhouettes) | 3 |
| `relay` | the aerial chain's overtake-and-strike-back | 3 |

---

## 5. What Encounter must code

| # | Code | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **The style applier.** After `_select`, score the styles in `styles.json` (gates, weights, one composition-stream draw) and transform the branch's `dynamic` beats by the overlay slots in section 1 | This is the one new mechanism. Slot identification: the approach is the first `rush` at tick 0; contacts are `strike`s; the decider is the last strike before a `launch` in the branch; the pursuit is the `rush` or `finRush` after it |
| 2 | **`rush` arguments:** `arc` (the height of the path's midpoint, a quadratic curve), `offY` (vertical offset at arrival), `ground` (hug the terrain and emit skid dust) | Backward-compatible: absent arguments keep today's straight path |
| 3 | **The `blink` op:** `{w, rel, dist}`. W teleports to a slot relative to the other fighter (`above`, `behind`, `below`, `front`), or both meet at the midpoint (`w: "both", rel: "meet"`), with the ripple fx at departure and arrival | No RNG: slots come from the data, cycling in order |
| 4 | **The `volley` op:** `{w, count, gapTicks, travelTicks, dmgEach, result}`. It schedules one arrival strike per blast (`result`: `land`, `guard` or `evade`), and emits the render-only projectile fx | No sim entities; blasts are not parryable |
| 5 | **`strike` `o` flags:** `kbMul` (knockback multiplier) and `crater` (`{radius, depth}` at the contact point, through World's crater rules) | Ground brawl |
| 6 | **Chains by `chainP`.** At each window, one draw against `chainP` (`styles.json`): continue with a link, or play the ender. Blitz is chosen at the first window. Links start a fixed `linkGap` or `blitzGap` after the last, with no press delay; no window opens after the ender | Replaces the chain press for both fighters (R9) |
| 7 | **Beam-clash shapes.** `startClash` and `clashResolve` pick a shape from the score margin and context (section 2.6), set `game.clash.shape` and its keyframes, and resolve by shape: deflect fires the loser's beam on the deflected path, split fires two veering beams, mutual blast detonates at the midpoint | The draws are unchanged: the two clash scores |
| 8 | **Mood and act as selector inputs.** Game Design's mood value (band) and act index are director state (Encounter's Q4 plan, section D); styles, `chainP`, blitz and beam shapes read them | The dialogue director stays read-only |
| 10 | **The R4 counter from data.** Read `selectorByProfile[profile]` before `selector`, and supply `defHeld` (S.T − D.stanceT) in the plan context | Parked edit 3, section 6 |
| 11 | **The finisher kind.** Copy `finishers.json` `kind` into `finisher_start`; draw the struggle once at `contestOpen` by `contest.struggle.byState`; emit the pulses at `beatTicks` | Parked edits 1 and 2, section 6 |
| 12 | **The clash score from data.** In the dynamic profile, read `styles.json` `beamClash.score`: tier 10, ki 0.35, a 0 to 16 draw, and the meter term by fighter. The CLASH rule stays the state rule in `templates.json` (AGGRESSIVE with 40 ki or more) | R9 answer 2 |
| 9 | Keep `cue` emission for every new beat, and add the new cue names to the fx hash map | Rendering maps them |

**Staging:**
1. Rows 1, 2 and 5: ground and aerial. They are cheap and change the most frames.
2. Rows 3 and 6: blink and clean chains.
3. Row 4: volleys.
4. Row 7: beam shapes.
5. Row 8 whenever the mood feed is ready. Until then, use `momentum` from decisive results as the stand-in.

## 6. Parked data edits (land after World's slice, with Tools' schemas)
These edits change `templates.json` and `finishers.json`, and therefore the data hash and the goldens. They land after World's slice and the dynamic slice, in one commit with Tools' schema changes and Encounter's Q4 loader work (EP-approved). The finished copies are with Combat.

| # | File | Edit | Schema change for Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `finishers.json` | `"kind"` on every finisher: `generic.placeholder` launch, `generic` launch, `kai` beam, `vorr` launch | `$defs.finisher.properties.kind`: enum `launch`, `melee`, `beam` |
| 2 | `finishers.json` | `contest.struggle.byState`: base 0.15 (as parked; Game Design later raised the struggle's base to 0.23, which is the live value); stance read +0.15 on a match (launch: DEFENSIVE; melee: EVASIVE; beam: AGGRESSIVE with 40 ki), +0.05 otherwise; +0.05 at 50 ki or more; −0.10 per Rally; −0.10 per minute past 8:00; fighter-state hooks | `contest.struggle.properties.byState` (object). Later, drop the press fields `halfWidthTicks`, `assistHalfWidthTicks`, `debounceTicks`, `inputs`, `aiHitChance` and the press `scoring` from `required` |
| 3 | `templates.json` | PRESSURE `selectorByProfile.dynamic`: the R4 counter (50% after 2 s held DEFENSIVE with more than 25 ki, 20% otherwise; one draw) | template `properties.selectorByProfile`: an object of profile name to selector (same shape as `selector`); the condition variable `defHeld` |
| 4 | `finishers.json` | about 30 new cue names in `cues` | none (`cues` takes any string keys) |
| 5 | `styles.json` (in the tree, not loaded) | the whole file | done: Tools' `combat-styles.schema.json` is mapped, and the file validates |

## 7. How we will know it worked
QA's feel probe (`qa/godot/feel/`) plus a style census from the structured event log:
- **Variety:**
  - every style fires in its context;
  - no style is above 45% of melee exchanges in the default arm;
  - each beam shape at least 5% of clashes (breakthrough and mutual blast at least 3%).
- **Clean combos:**
  - every chain of 2 or more ends on an ender;
  - links on a fixed 18-tick rhythm;
  - no two consecutive links with the same shape cue.
- **Feel holds:** the dynamic-feel targets still pass (melee idle at most 15%, still stretch p90 at most 0.5 s).
- **Orb plays it.** "Never the same series twice" (procedural-moves T4) gets its first real test.

## 8. Open for others
- **Game Design:** volley and barrage damage (placeholders in `styles.json`); split and mutual-blast chip damage; the deflect ki cost; the director's parry and struggle rolls (their redesign).
- **Narrative:** the CHAIN ×N label is theirs; the lines keyed to mood and stance history.
- **World:** small stomp craters within the new crater rules; ground throws that slide.
- **Tools:** the schema changes for parked edits 1 to 3 (section 6). `styles.json` already has its schema.

---

## 9. What ADR 0008 changes here

Plan only; no data changes until Orb gives the go on the control scheme (`docs/decisions/0008-control-scheme.md`). The styles, the chain structure and the clash shapes all stay. What changes is who chooses.

| Part of this pass | Before | With ADR 0008 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Energy blasts** (2.5) | a director style, weighted by a `volley` trait | the player's **energy mode**: a piece family (`moveset-system.md` section 9.1). `volley_barrage` and `volley_opener` become the energy versions of PRESSURE and of the approach. The trait weights apply only where the director picks the mode: the AI and the Simple layout |
| **Direction** | not an input | the held direction picks the entry (rush, stand, retreat). Styles keep choosing *how* that entry looks: aerial arcs, ground skids, blinks |
| **Chains** (2.1) | the director draws `chainP` at each window | **queued presses** set the length. The director still times the links on the fixed rhythm and plays the ender on the last one. `chainP` and the blitz chance remain for the AI and the Simple layout. The defender's answer is the **burst**, replacing the break-out window |
| **Parry** (section 4, R5) | a director roll by state | a **perfect block**: a timed tap during the visible wind-up; a mistimed tap still blocks. The clean-parry reward in the `parry` data block is its reward. The R5 roll remains for the AI and the Simple layout |
| **Beam struggles** (2.6) | CLASH whenever the defender is AGGRESSIVE with 40 ki or more | a struggle starts only when a beam is **answered by a beam**. The six shapes and the margin rule are unchanged. A perfect block against a beam is a DEFLECT outcome, separate from the *deflect* clash shape |
| **Telegraphs** (section 4) | weight and finisher kind | unchanged, and more important: the wind-up tell is now the perfect-block window, and the mode shows as a tell too (`tell_energy`: the hands light) |
| **New in-exchange windows** | parry and chain only | perfect block, dodge cancel, burst and reversal (`moveset-system.md` section 9.5). Each template branch will list them as data |
| **Context actions** | none | grab and throw, pick-up, the civilians action, provoke or feint, energy shove, reversal, deflect, tackle and dive grab get their own small template family (`moveset-system.md` section 9.3) |

**The parked Q4 batch (section 6) under ADR 0008:**

| # | Edit | Still valid? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | finisher `kind` | **Yes.** The read against the kind moves from stances to held states (Guard, Dodge, Press with a beam in hand) |
| 2 | `contest.struggle.byState` | **Yes, with two updates on merge:** the base becomes Game Design's current value (0.23 since `6be4c3a`; the parked copy says 0.15), and the stance labels become held states |
| 3 | PRESSURE's R4 counter as `selectorByProfile.dynamic` | **Replaced.** Game Design re-ruled R4 (`stance-matrix.md` section 7.3): a held guard never counters by itself, for humans or the AI. The counter comes from a perfect block (the riposte) or a reversal, as interrupts on GUARD HOLDS (`control-scheme-data.md`) |
| 4 | the new cue names | **Yes.** More will follow (the mode tell, the context actions) |

**Launch vectors.** MOUNTAINSIDE is retired in favour of brunts on World's natural formations (mesa, rock, spire, big tree): `moveset-system.md` section 9.8. The ground and aerial styles' launch hints are unaffected.

**Wind-ups.** Strikes that can be perfect-blocked need wind-ups of 15 ticks (light) and 20 (heavy), and the chain ender 18, so the dynamic profile's timings and the `chains.ender` beats will move when the scheme lands (`moveset-system.md` section 9.7).

**A future edit, not in the batch:** `templates.json` `beam.outcome` drops the automatic CLASH rule in favour of the answered-beam rule. It lands with Encounter's revised Q4 plan.
