# docs/controls: Controls and Game Feel

Owner: Controls and Game Feel. Date: 2026-09-29. Design first; code in `sim/input/` follows when the EP hands over the tree (ADR 0006).

| File | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| [haptics.md](haptics.md) | **The pulse for a launch opening** (`SimHaptics`, pure; the host's one connect as a patch), device rules, proof |
| [brake-and-grapple.md](brake-and-grapple.md) | **Built, parked behind switches:** the air brake's bit on a Simple slot, `struggle_press`'s A only, `catch_read` and `brace_read`, `a_read`'s shove and clinch retired |
| [grapple-input.md](grapple-input.md) | **The grapple's inputs** (paper): the catch and the clinch on A, the carry and the brace, every layout, touch Simple's three options |
| [struggle-input.md](struggle-input.md) | **The beam struggle's inputs on every layout** (paper): the surge, the stray, the let-go, Simple and touch, the traps |
| [local-two-player.md](local-two-player.md) | **Local two-player:** the join rule, every pairing of devices, leaving, per-player layouts, what Rendering and UI wire, and Orb's manual checks |
| [remap.md](remap.md) | The Full touch preset and what UI's Remap screen calls (overrides, checks, persistence, shared names) |
| [i2c.md](i2c.md) | **I2c as built:** the layout layer produces intent v2 for keyboard, pad and touch; files, glue, proof, gaps |
| [phone-test-checklist.md](phone-test-checklist.md) | A 15-minute real-phone test for Orb: landscape, several fingers, left-handed, portrait, latency, browser interference |
| [touch-bridge.md](touch-bridge.md) | The touch Simple bridge to today's intents: mapping, files, host patch, tests, what UI builds |
| [input-scheme.md](input-scheme.md) | **Current (ADR 0008):** actions, the three controller layouts, tap and hold rules, keyboard (solo and shared), touch Simple and Full, the intent record, stage plan, tests |
| [input-schema.md](input-schema.md) | **Current:** data model, presets and schemas for Tools (`actions`, `layouts`, `timing`, user file) |
| [rulings.md](rulings.md) | Rulings on Combat's proposals: parry, chain and wind-up widths in ticks, buffering, anti-mash, hit-stop table, finisher struggle, latency budget, draft data, ranked risks with tests |
| [input-map.md](input-map.md) | Keyboard (P1, P2) and gamepad maps, the intent record, special and transform holds per fighter, parity rules |
| [shake-pass.md](shake-pass.md) | Per-event shake for Camera, and the split's per-pane rule |
| [prompt-glyphs.md](prompt-glyphs.md) | Prompt glyphs per device family for UI |
| [stage-c-spec.md](stage-c-spec.md) | **Final Stage C spec:** sticky weight, the signature intent, the sim shape, tests, draft data, the final stage plan |
| [stage-a-proof.md](stage-a-proof.md) | Stage A proof checklist for QA (integer hit-stop, inert intent fields, bit-identical goldens) |
| [stage-c-tests.md](stage-c-tests.md) | Stage C test scripts and batch checks (weight, signature intent, holds) |
| [feel-schema.md](feel-schema.md) | JSON Schema and cross-reference rules for `data/input/feel.json`, for Tools |
| [intent-queue-plan.md](intent-queue-plan.md) | options considered before Game Design's answers (superseded by stage-c-spec.md) |
| [platform-plan.md](platform-plan.md) | Gamepad in the web build and on desktop (Godot input), rebinding, tests, and mobile's two schemes |

This folder replaces the wave-1 plan for `docs/feel/` (tuning table, input map, risks): its content is folded into `rulings.md` and `input-map.md`.
