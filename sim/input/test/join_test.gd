## Local two-player, end to end through the real sim (docs/controls/local-two-player.md): the join rule, every pairing of
## devices (pad and pad, pad and keyboard, the shared keyboard halves, touch and pad), the way out, per-player layouts,
## and that who played on what changes nothing the sim records. The loop below does what SimHost.tick does with the hub:
## drain the joins and leaves, tell the hub who is human, take an intent for each human slot, step, spend the edges.
## From the repo root:
##   godot --headless --path . --script res://sim/input/test/join_test.gd
## Exit 0 if every check passes.
