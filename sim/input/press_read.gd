extends RefCounted
## The press reader for the "fight alchemist" (docs/controls/agency-input.md, 1a): from a short log of a fighter's attack
## presses it says whether the player is holding, tapping in time with the blows, mashing, or tapping deliberately, and
## what the running mix of attack types is. Pure functions over plain data: no state, no engine, no clock, no RNG, so the
## sim, the AI, QA and the tests all read a log the same way and a replay reproduces it. The log itself is the sim's state
## (Encounter and Simulation own it); this file only builds and reads it.
##
## A log is an Array of entries, oldest first, at most `logSize` long (20: the running mix; the recipe reads the latest `mixShort`, 5):
##   {kind: int (LIGHT, HEAVY, SIG, CONTEXT), mode: int (0 physical, 1 energy), down: int tick, up: int tick or -1 while held,
##    beat: int, stance: int (the stance mask the press was made in, 0 martial; absent reads as 0)}
## `beat` is the signed distance in ticks from the press to the nearest blow contact of the running exchange (negative:
## early), or NO_BEAT outside one. A charged press (a hold at range or close) also carries `flash`: the tick the sim's
## charge flashed, or NO_FLASH; releasing on the flash is the timed release. The director stamps the PLANNED flash tick when
## the charge begins (a tick that may still be ahead), so a release before it reads as "early" rather than as no grade. All numbers are data (timing.json, the `read`
## block), whole ticks at 60 a second.
##
## Timing grades (docs/controls/agency-input.md 1a): a press or a release is "perfect" within beatHalf ticks of its mark, "good"
## within 2 * beatHalf, otherwise "off". A style's top level comes from perfect timing: a steady mash, three perfect presses in
## a row, or a hold released on the flash. The sim reads the grade; the damage, the blur and the guard break are Game Design's.
##
## Agency pass section 20 (2026-10-03): "steady" is on the beat, with no spacing test: the last steadyPresses presses are each
## within blurBeatHalf ticks of a DIFFERENT blow's contact (the contact is `down - beat`), consecutive in the log, so any press
## between them that is off a blow breaks it and two presses on one blow count once. It is immune to hit-stop (live contacts are a
## cadence plus 4 to 5 ticks apart, and a TRADE BLOWS opener lands 28 and 44 ticks apart) and to the opener's rhythm; a blind
## metronome is not steady because it is not on the blows. The window of presses lapses as a whole after expireTicks with no press
## (not press by press), and the recipe style (blur, combo, power)
## goes by the share of heavies among the presses present, so a lone heavy is a power blow.

## Read a log at tick `now`. `opts`: touch (bool, the wider beat window), assist (bool, the doubled one), offset (int, the
## player's timing offset in ticks, -6 to 6: it shifts where the beat is for them), p (a params dictionary, for tests).
## `slow` (bool) is a 30 fps client: the blur's beat gets blurBeatBonus ticks more, as on touch (0 now: no extra tolerance).
## Returns {style, hold_ticks, on_beat, presses, mix_short, mix_long, recipe, rate}:
##   style: "none" (nothing recent), "hold", "rhythm", "mash" or "taps";
##   timing: "perfect" (a timed string: a steady mash, a run of perfect presses, or the last release on the flash), "good" (some
##     timing: a perfect press or a good release) or "none";
##   streak: perfect presses in a row ending at the latest; steady: the last steadyPresses presses are each within blurBeatHalf
##     ticks of a different blow's contact, consecutive, with no spacing test (any style: it makes timing perfect);
##   release: the grade of the latest released charge ("none" if there is none);

##   on_beat: how many of the last `rhythmOf` presses were on the beat;
##   mix_short / mix_long: {light, heavy, sig, energy} counts over the last `mixShort` and `logSize` presses; the whole window is
##     empty once `expireTicks` (90) have passed with no press;

##     "blur" (no heavy), "combo" (heavies up to powerShare percent) or "power" (over it). With five presses present: none is
##     blur, one to three combo, four or five power; a lone heavy is power;
##   rate: presses a second over the latest `mixShort` presses (0 with fewer than two); for display only.
## Precedence: hold, then rhythm, then mash, then taps. A mash that lands on the blows is rhythm.
