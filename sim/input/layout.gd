extends RefCounted
## The layout layer for keyboards and pads (docs/controls/input-scheme.md, intent-v2.md): physical controls in, one
## intent v2 per fixed tick out. A preset from data/input/layouts.json says which control is which action; this class
## resolves tap against hold, the power layer and the transform chord in tick time, so the sim receives resolved
## requests and held states and never sees a device. It also writes today's dash and charge next to the v2 fields,
## because fighter.gd still reads them until I3, and leaves `stance` unset (a v2 slot's stance is derived from the held
## guard, dodge and sprint by SimAct).
##
## Engine-agnostic: no Input, no Node, no clock. The host feeds press, release, axis and analog as events arrive and
## calls build() once per fixed tick and consumed() when SimCore.step took the input (it does not on a hit-stop tick), so
## a press waits through a freeze as the old keyboard edges did.
##
## Rules (input-scheme.md section 3):
##  - a tap fires on press, with no delay: dodge, guard (and its perfect-block edge), light, heavy, signature, context,
##    mode and the power press all report on the tick they land;
##  - a hold adds behaviour on top: a dodge held for holdStart ticks is a sprint, power held for holdStart ticks is the
##    channel (charge), a power tap released before that is powerTap, and a layer press (power held plus a face button)
##    is a special or the signature and voids the pending tap;
##  - two triggers down within chordWindow ticks are the transform chord: no sprint, charge or tap comes from them, and
##    transform is sent once they have been held transformConfirm ticks. A single transform control does the same alone;
##  - mode is momentary by default (docs/controls/agency-input.md): held, the attacks are the energy ones; the mode style
##    "toggle" keeps the old latch (an accessibility setting) and "hybrid" (touch) latches on a tap and is momentary on a hold;
##  - lightHeld and heavyHeld are levels: true while a light or a heavy button is down (a Simple attack control with a hold
##    gesture reads as light until holdStart, then as heavy), so the sim can tell a tap from a hold and see its release;
##  - escape is an edge from its own control (provisional: R3, a key, a swipe up on Guard on touch);
##  - a press of an attack button within debounce ticks of its own release is the same press (worn pad contacts);
##  - a preset whose attack control has a hold gesture (the Simple layouts) fires its light on release and a heavy at
##    holdStart, because today's director cannot upgrade a request it has already started (touch-bridge.md).

## The held-attack bridge: true while the director starts an exchange the moment it gets a request. Encounter's queue
## (I2 later) turns it off, and a light then fires on press and the hold upgrades it.
