class_name DirAlchemy
## The fight alchemist's press log (docs/director/alchemy-plan.md A1; docs/design/agency-pass.md section 2). Every attack
## press of each fighter is kept with what it carried: weight, family, direction, tilt, when it was let go, its beat (the
## distance to the nearest blow contact of the running exchange) and its charge's flash. Controls' classifier
## (SimPressRead) reads the log: holding, tapping in time, mashing or tapping; perfect, good or off; a steady mash; a
## release on the flash. That read is recorded with each press (READ). In the dynamic profile the timed tag and the
## flow follow the beat (Controls' grade; in a blur string the blur's own beat, DirBlur); the mashed tag is three
## presses inside MASH_TICKS.
##
## The log lives in the director's per-fighter integers (f.act.dirI), after DirInterrupt's: a ring of the last RING
## presses (packed presses, their ticks, their release ticks, beats and flashes), the count of presses, the last live
## tick, the held levels of the tick before, Controls' aim latch and the last read.
##
## One clock, S.tick, which runs through hit-stop: a press or a release made in a freeze of h ticks arrives on the first
## live tick, so it is graded at S.tick - h (Controls' rule).
