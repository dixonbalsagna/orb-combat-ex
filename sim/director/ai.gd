class_name DirAI
## Opponent AI (Encounter Systems): born as the twin of ai.js (pickW, aiInput); since ADR 0006 it has its own tempo and
## fight-location rules (balance-targets.md section 10): a slower attack cadence, the hero's lure toward empty land
## instead of the sea, fighters who stay at the surface unless hiding, and escape cover that prefers forest and ridge.
## Timers count down by the fixed DT.
