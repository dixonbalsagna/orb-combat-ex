class_name DirBands
## The ranged press (agency-pass.md section 1; docs/director/agency-slice-2.md and agency-slice-3.md): three bands by
## distance, the approach that comes before an exchange, and the far band's taunt and charge.
##  - A strike never exists at range: an exchange is planned only inside the close band.
##  - The exchange starts at the wind-up: a press from farther off starts only the attacker's own move, a lunge in the
##    mid band and a flight in the far band. The rival is free while it comes. When it ends the exchange is planned
##    from where both then stand and what the rival is then doing, exactly as a close press is.
##  - In the far band a tap is a taunt and a hold is a charge. The taunt is a challenge: the rival's attack press
##    while it plays answers it, and both rush and meet in the middle. A held light is a fast charge that stops, for
##    nothing, when the button is let go; a held heavy is slower, committed, and can earn a launch.
## None of it is an exchange: S.dirS.ex stays null. It lives in the fighter's director state (f.act.dirI:
## DirInterrupt.APPR_*, TAUNT_*) and in his rush. One approach at a time: while it is on, his own later presses wait as
## his links, the rival's press waits to be read at the engage, and only the rival's signature starts (it ends the
## approach). Numbers: data/director/interrupts.json `bands`. Nothing here runs in a profile without the perfect block.
