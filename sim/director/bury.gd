class_name DirBury
## The buried fighter (agency-pass.md sections 7 and 14.5; World's embed, docs/world/ground-contact.md section 19). A
## hard impact drives a fighter into its crater: World holds him down for its embed ticks (Fighter.embedT). The
## director's part:
##  - The free follow-up is a dive with a time limit and no distance limit: his rival presses within followTicks, the
##    director flies him to the crater at dive.speed, and the blow must land by landByTick of the burial. If he cannot
##    arrive in time there is no follow-up. It lands clean, deepens the crater and does not launch.
##  - A blast is the other free blow: with the energy family held, the press sends a charged shot into the crater. It
##    arrives from any distance (the shot's own rule) and is the weaker choice.
##  - He is held until the blow lands, and never past landByTick. Nothing of his stops a follow-up on its way.
##  - His guard counts only from guardFromTick, or once the follow-up has been used. Buried, he never dodges or presses.
##  - His burst throws him out, but not before burstFromTick. An AI bursts only when no follow-up is coming: from that
##    tick, with its rival within burstWithinBh, at its level's rate (one draw a burial).
##  - He comes out with safeTicks of safety: no exchange starts on him and no shot lands. The safety covers World's
##    get-up after its ticks as well.
##  - One follow-up to a burial. An exchange that takes him out of the crater ends the burial.
## State: the buried fighter's director state (f.act.dirI: DirInterrupt.BURY_*, SAFE_UNTIL). Numbers:
## data/director/interrupts.json `buried`. The follow-up's piece is an interim of the director's own (a rush, one heavy
## blow of class none, no launch, no chain window) until Combat authors it.
