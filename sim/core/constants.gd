class_name SimConst
## Fixed timestep and planet constants. NC is an int because it sizes and indexes arrays.
##
## World scale (docs/world/scale.md): the world is grown against the fighters, which stay as they are (a fighter is
## about 75 units tall). Three knobs, all in this file:
##  WS  feature scale. Buildings, trees, terrain relief, craters, scorch and the world's damage radii are multiplied by it.
##  PS  planet scale. The planet's length, and the biome spans and settlements laid along it, are multiplied by it.
##  TRAV_FREE and TRAV_LAUNCH  traversal factors. Free-flight dash and the horizontal part of a launch are multiplied
##  by these, so fighters cross the bigger world at anime speed while melee stays at fighter scale.
## The original planet is WS = PS = 1 with both traversal factors 1.

## Fight lanes (ADR 0009, docs/architecture/fight-lanes.md): the band of depth fighters, props and beams live in. z is
## positive toward the camera and the fighter plane is z = 0. Placeholders for World's lane table (S.lanes, L1).
