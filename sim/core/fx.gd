## Cosmetic effects leave the sim as events: the twin of fx.js (docs/architecture/fx-events.md). Each function appends
## one FxEvent to S.out.fx and changes no sim state; the render side (view/fx.gd is the reference consumer) turns them
## into particles, damage numbers, the banner and camera shake with its own cosmetic streams. The GDScript core has
## only the canonical 'split' mode, so no emitter draws anything (fx.js's 'shared' mode exists for prototype parity).
