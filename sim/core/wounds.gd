class_name SimWounds
## Wounds, slice S1 (docs/design/spec-wounds.md §1 and §4; plan in docs/architecture/wounds-plan.md): body regions with
## wear, stages, the brink and recovery. Wear is fixed-point: WEAR_SCALE integer units per wear point, so the spec's
## rates are whole numbers per 60 Hz tick (1 wear per second is exactly 100 units per tick) and nothing drifts.
##
## S2 (Encounter): the HP bar no longer ends the match (HP_ENDS_MATCH false); only a finisher can KO (the director,
## sim/director/exchange.gd). Tuning: k 0.034 (Game Design's final, spec §1b; S3b had 0.065 and §1b's first 0.20
## gave 90 s matches), bruised fade 0.25 per second, focus weight (1 + wear/30). Still provisional: the region picker (family
## weights by attack kind), until per-atom weights arrive.
## S3a (Simulation): the core-side stage penalties (constants below; spec §1 "Stage penalties"). S3b (Encounter) adds the
## director-side ones. S4 (Simulation): Rally, the shared rule (spec §2; the Rally section below). Per-fighter profiles
## (F1) come later.
## Pitch A, "the crippling moment" (Orb; pitches.md §5, balance-targets.md §13): the brink is the core broken; limbs wear
## to battered and stop, spilling the rest into the core; a limb breaks only in a crippling moment (the section below).
## D1a: every per-fighter number is data (data/fighters/<id>/wounds.json), read here through f.wd (FighterData.WoundsDef).
## What stays below is the shared frame (regions, the unit scale, the overtime ramp) and five pinned values that other
## owners' files still read as constants; the loader requires the data to equal them until those readers move to f.wd.

const REGIONS: Array = ["head", "core", "arms", "legs"]
const HEAD: int = 0
const CORE: int = 1
const ARMS: int = 2
const LEGS: int = 3

const WEAR_SCALE: int = 6000                 # units per wear point
const WEAR_MAX: int = 600000                 # 100 wear
## k (wear per damage point, in units) is f.wd.wearPerDamage: 204 = 0.034 x 6000, Game Design's final (spec §1b).
## The overtime ramp (f.wd.overtimeStart, overtimePerMin, overtimeCap: k x min(cap, 1 + perMin x minutes past the
## start)) and the act-1 damping (f.wd.act1Damping while act() is 1) are data (spec-wounds.md §1b).
## Stage floors in units: bruised 30, battered 60, broken 90. Stages: 0 fresh, 1 bruised, 2 battered, 3 broken.
## Pinned: sim/director/ai.gd and qa/godot/records.gd read it (f.wd.stageAt is the fighter's own copy).
const STAGE_AT: Array = [180000, 360000, 540000]
## Pinned (sim/director/ai.gd): battered regions fade down to 59 (f.wd.hiddenFloor). The fade rates, second breath's delay
## (spec-wounds.md §1c) and the region weights by hit family are f.wd.fadeOut, fadeBreath, breathAfter, fadeHidden and
## family.
const FADE_HIDDEN_FLOOR: int = 354000
## S2: only a finisher can KO (spec §1, "The end"). The HP bar no longer ends the match.
const HP_ENDS_MATCH: bool = false
## "Go for the wound": a region's pick weight is multiplied by (1 + wear / f.wd.focusWear) (spec §1b).

## Stage penalties (S3a core side, S3b director side): battered means stage 2 or more (a broken region keeps its battered
## penalty). The numbers are f.wd: coreKiRegen, legsSpeed, legsLockBreak, staggerTicks, dazeTicks, armsGuardMul and
## armsBrokenMul. Pinned (the director reads the constants):
