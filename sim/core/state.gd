extends RefCounted
## The whole simulation state: the GDScript twin of the JS object S (module-spec section 2). Field names match the
## JS ones, so the two cores read alike and hash.gd walks them in the same order as hash.js. Every number is a float,
## because JS numbers are float64 and the hash sees their bits. Object references (a fighter, a clash, a beam's owner)
## stay references, as in JS.
