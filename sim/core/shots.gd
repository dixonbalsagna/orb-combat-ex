class_name SimShots
## Shots (docs/architecture/shots.md): energy blasts in flight. A shot is sim state (S.shots, hashed): it has an owner, a
## kind, a position that wraps with the planet, a power and a time to live. The director fires them (fire) and decides
## what a hit means; this module moves them and finds what they meet: each other, a fighter, the ground, the water.
##
## Three ways of travelling:
##   LINE  a straight line at the kind's speed until something stops it or its life runs out
##   SEEK  toward a fighter, arriving on a set tick whatever he does (the rush's rule): energy reaches at any range, so
##         a seeking shot is not stopped by the ground or the water between them
##   LOB   a fixed-time arc to a point
## Shots of opposing owners that meet trade: each loses the other's power, and one with none left ends. So volleys cancel
## in pairs and what is left of the bigger one lands.
## A meeting is a swept test over the tick's movement, so a fast shot never passes through a fighter or another shot.
## A fourth kind does not travel: a MINE stays where it is laid, arms, and blows when a rival comes within its trigger
## radius, a shot hits it, a blow lands on it (trip, tripNear) or another mine's blast reaches it.
## A deflected shot flies wild (deflect): an arc to a seeded spot on the ground, hitting whoever or whatever is in its way.
## A straight or lobbed shot stops at a standing building in its path (hitStructure).
## Two things are seeded, both stateless (SimRng.keyed on the match seed and the shot's id, never S.rng): the spray's aim
## and where a wild shot goes.
## Timers are whole live ticks. A shot fired this tick sits at its start until the next tick, then moves.
## Nothing here draws from S.rng. Speeds and sizes are data/fight/shots.json.
