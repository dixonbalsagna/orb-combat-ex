class_name WorldWater
## A one-dimensional water model over the terrain columns. GDScript only.
##
## S.water holds the water depth of every column, so the surface is ground + depth, and the surface of standing water
## is sea level. The sea is a reservoir: a column whose original ground is below RESERVOIR_BASE (the prototype's sea
## rule, seaAt) is always full to sea level, and its depth follows the ground when a crater digs the sea floor. Every
## other column is dynamic. Water gets into a dynamic column only by flowing from a wet neighbour, and only if the
## column's ground is below WET_GROUND (the same -30 the sea rule uses, so a shore looks as it always did). So a hole
## fills only when an unbroken run of ground below WET_GROUND connects it to the sea: an inland crater stays dry
## however deep, and a bay dug at the coast fills. That is the whole "no flooding inland" argument;
## docs/world/craters-scorch-water.md has the proof and the test.
##
## Flow is a saturated two-column exchange, computed from the old state and applied afterwards (order-free). It runs
## only in windows around terrain that was just changed below sea level, every WATER_STEP_TICKS unfrozen ticks, and a
## window closes once it has settled. Nothing here draws a random number.

## (docs/world/cities.md, the waterline). WET_GROUND is the same number under its old name.
