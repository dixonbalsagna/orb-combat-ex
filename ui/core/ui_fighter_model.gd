extends RefCounted
## What the HUD knows about one fighter: a view model, folded from events and patched from sim state. It is the only
## input the plate, crown and silhouette draw from. It never writes anywhere, draws no random numbers, and holds no
## numeric health: regions are stages, and the optional `wear` is used only to animate a smooth thinning.
