## Every colour role, size and timing the HUD uses, in one place (like render/core/look.gd). Colours are SEMANTIC ROLES
## with provisional hex values: Art owns the palette, Accessibility reviews the contrast. No cue relies on colour
## alone: every role is paired with a shape, pattern, icon or motion (docs/ui/hud-spec.md section 2).
