class_name UiHud
extends Control
## The HUD root: a full-rect Control that Rendering's main scene hosts under its CanvasLayer (replacing render/core/hud.gd).
## It reads events and state through its UiEventHub and never writes the sim, never draws from a random stream, and
## animates by wall time only, so it cannot change a match or a replay.
##
## It is a stack of cached layers (UiLayer): each keeps its drawing until a small signature changes, so at rest the HUD
## costs almost no GDScript and the crown layer, the cards and the barks draw nothing at all.
##
## How a host uses it:
##   var hud := preload("res://ui/hud/ui_hud.tscn").instantiate()
##   $HUD.add_child(hud)
##   hud.setup(["kai", "vorr"], ["KAI", "VORR"])          # readout profile ids and display names
##   hud.anchor_fn = func(slot): return {"pos": <fighter torso on screen>, "h": <fighter height in px>, "visible": true}
##   hud.strip_fn = func(): return {...}                  # planet strip data (see UiStrip)
##   every tick:   hud.consume_all(events); UiSimBridge.patch(hud, S)
##   every frame:  hud.advance(delta)                     # pass 0 while the game is paused
## The demo (ui/demo/hud_demo.tscn) shows all of it driven by the mock feed.
